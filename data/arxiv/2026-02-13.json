    "summary": "We present ROCKET, a training-free model compression method that achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with factorization, structured-sparsification and dynamic compression baselines. Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B. The code for ROCKET is at github.com/mts-ai/ROCKET/tree/main.",

While recent advances in financial natural language processing have enabled automated analysis of market reports, regulatory documents, and investor communications, existing benchmarks remain largely monolingual, text-only, and limited to narrow subtasks. FinMMEval 2026 addresses this gap by offering three interconnected tasks that span financial understanding, reasoning, and decision-making: Financial Exam Question Answering, Multilingual Financial Question Answering (PolyFiQA), and Financial Decision Making. Together, these tasks provide a comprehensive evaluation suite that measures models' ability to reason, generalize, and act across diverse languages and modalities. The lab aims to promote the development of robust, transparent, and globally inclusive financial AI systems, with datasets and evaluation resources publicly released to support reproducible research.",

This study presents the spatial-morphological (SM) imputer tool, which combines data-driven morphological clustering with neighborhood-based methods to reconstruct missing values of the floor space index (FSI) and ground space index (GSI) at the city block level, inspired by the SpaceMatrix framework. This approach combines city-scale morphological patterns as global priors with local spatial information for context-dependent interpolation. The evaluation shows that while SM alone captures meaningful morphological structure, its combination with inverse distance weighting (IDW) or spatial k-nearest neighbor (sKNN) methods provides superior performance compared to existing SOTA models. Composite methods demonstrate the complementary advantages of combining morphological and spatial approaches.",

    "summary": "Despite rapid progress on coding agents, progress on their multimodal counterparts has lagged behind. A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%. We release GameDevBench publicly to support further research into agentic game development.",

    "summary": "Preference optimization for diffusion and flow-matching models relies on reward functions that are both discriminatively robust and computationally efficient. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as the primary reward provider, leveraging their rich multimodal priors to guide alignment. However, their computation and memory cost can be substantial, and optimizing a latent diffusion generator through a pixel-space reward introduces a domain mismatch that complicates alignment. In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost. In preference optimization, we demonstrate that DiNa-LRM improves preference optimization dynamics, enabling faster and more resource-efficient model alignment.",

We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5. We provide extensive ablation studies to quantify these contributions and commit to open research by first releasing inference code and model weights at https://github.com/soda-inria/tabicl, with synthetic data engine and pretraining code to follow.",

    "summary": "In federated learning (FL), $K$ clients jointly train a model without sharing raw data. Because each participant invests data and compute, clients need mechanisms to later prove the provenance of a jointly trained model. Model watermarking embeds a hidden signal in the weights, but naive approaches either do not scale with many clients as per-client watermarks dilute as $K$ grows, or give any individual client the ability to verify and potentially remove the watermark. We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $τ$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $τ$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification. Our watermark remains detectable at scale ($K=128$) with minimal accuracy loss and stays above the detection threshold ($z\\ge 4$) under attacks including adaptive fine-tuning using up to 20% of the training data.",

However, these transforms are computationally expensive when employed as differentiable loss functions for stochastic gradient descent due to their numerous paths, which significantly limits their use in neural network training. Against this problem, we propose \"Scattering transform with Random Paths for machine Learning\" (SCRAPL): a stochastic optimization scheme for efficient evaluation of multivariable scattering transforms. We implement SCRAPL for the joint time-frequency scattering transform (JTFS) which demodulates spectrotemporal patterns at multiple scales and rates, allowing a fine characterization of intermittent auditory textures. We apply SCRAPL to differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP), specifically, unsupervised sound matching of a granular synthesizer and the Roland TR-808 drum machine. We also propose an initialization heuristic based on importance sampling, which adapts SCRAPL to the perceptual content of the dataset, improving neural network convergence and evaluation performance. We make our code and audio samples available and provide SCRAPL as a Python package.",

Traditional approaches rely on supervised training with word-level aligned data, which is difficult to collect at scale and thus depends on synthetic alignments using language-specific heuristics that are suboptimal. We propose Hibiki-Zero, which eliminates the need for word-level alignments entirely. This fundamentally simplifies the training pipeline and enables seamless scaling to diverse languages with varying grammatical structures, removing the bottleneck of designing language-specific alignment heuristics. We first train on sentence-level aligned data to learn speech translation at high latency, then apply a novel reinforcement learning strategy using GRPO to optimize latency while preserving translation quality. Hibiki-Zero achieves state-of-the-art performance in translation accuracy, latency, voice transfer, and naturalness across five X-to-English tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model can be adapted to support a new input language with less than 1000h of speech. We provide examples, model weights, inference code and we release a benchmark containing 45h of multilingual data for speech translation evaluation.",

    "summary": "Developing efficient GPU kernels is essential for scaling modern AI systems, yet it remains a complex task due to intricate hardware architectures and the need for specialized optimization expertise. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general sequential code generation, they face significant challenges in GPU code generation because of the scarcity of high-quality labeled training data, compiler biases when generating synthetic solutions, and limited generalization across hardware generations. This precludes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a scalable methodology for improving current LLMs. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a data-efficient and adaptive alternative but requires access to relevant tools, careful selection of training problems, and a robust evaluation environment. We present Makora's environment and tools for reinforcement learning finetuning of frontier models and report our results from fine-tuning GPT-5 for Triton code generation. In the single-attempt setting, our fine-tuned model improves kernel correctness from 43.7% to 77.0% (+33.3 percentage points) and increases the fraction of problems outperforming TorchInductor from 14.8% to 21.8% (+7 percentage points) compared to baseline GPT-5, while exceeding prior state-of-the-art models on KernelBench. When integrated into a full coding agent, it is able to solve up to 97.4% of problems in an expanded KernelBench suite, outperforming the PyTorch TorchInductor compiler on 72.9% of problems with a geometric mean speedup of 2.12x. Our work demonstrates that targeted post-training with reinforcement learning can unlock LLM capabilities in highly specialized technical domains where traditional supervised learning is limited by data availability, opening new pathways for AI-assisted accelerator programming.",

    "summary": "Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.",

However, its practical adoption is hindered by poor data efficiency and limited policy expressivity, especially in offline or data-scarce regimes.

This design enables tractable log-likelihood computation, efficient sampling, and the ability to model rich multimodal behaviors. New theoretical guarantees are derived, including explicit KL-divergence bounds for Real-valued non-volume preserving (RealNVP) policies and PAC-style sample efficiency results, showing that NF-HIQL preserves stability while improving generalization. Empirically, NF-HIQL is evaluted across diverse long-horizon tasks in locomotion, ball-dribbling, and multi-step manipulation from OGBench. NF-HIQL consistently outperforms prior goal-conditioned and hierarchical baselines, demonstrating superior robustness under limited data and highlighting the potential of flow-based architectures for scalable, data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning.",

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.",

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.",

    "title": "Flow caching for autoregressive video generation",
    "summary": "Autoregressive models, often built on Transformer architectures, represent a powerful paradigm for generating ultra-long videos by synthesizing content in sequential chunks. However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively). These results demonstrate that FlowCache successfully unlocks the potential of autoregressive models for real-time, ultra-long video generation-establishing a new benchmark for efficient video synthesis at scale.

    "summary": "Super-resolution (SR) applied to real-world low-resolution (LR) images often results in complex, irregular degradations that stem from the inherent complexity of natural scene acquisition. In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets. Experiments on real SR-IQA benchmarks demonstrate that S3 RIQA consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art relevant metrics.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic perception and control, yet most existing approaches primarily rely on VLM trained using 2D images, which limits their spatial understanding and action grounding in complex 3D environments. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

This interest, combined with the commoditization of actuators, has propelled growth in low-cost robotic platforms.

We introduce YOR, an open-source, low-cost mobile manipulator that integrates an omnidirectional base, a telescopic vertical lift, and two arms with grippers to achieve whole-body mobility and manipulation.

In this work, we adapt our previously proposed SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) mechanism to the ViT architecture, introducing a geometrically grounded formulation that enhances interpretability, sparsity, and spectral structure. We apply the use of interpretability indicators -- originally proposed with SVDA -- to monitor attention dynamics during training and assess structural properties of the learned representations. Experimental evaluations on four widely used benchmarks -- CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-100 -- demonstrate that SVDA consistently yields more interpretable attention patterns without sacrificing classification accuracy. While the current framework offers descriptive insights rather than prescriptive guidance, our results establish SVDA as a comprehensive and informative tool for analyzing and developing structured attention models in computer vision.

    "summary": "Generative recommendation via autoregressive models has unified retrieval and ranking into a single conditional generation framework. However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.",

While multimodal content offers a promising solution, existing methods result in suboptimal representations for new items due to noise and entanglement in sparse data. To address this, we transform multimodal recommendation into discrete semantic tokenization. We present Sparse-Regularized Multimodal Tokenization for Cold-Start Recommendation (MoToRec), a framework centered on a sparsely-regularized Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) that generates a compositional semantic code of discrete, interpretable tokens, promoting disentangled representations. MoToRec's architecture is enhanced by three synergistic components: (1) a sparsely-regularized RQ-VAE that promotes disentangled representations, (2) a novel adaptive rarity amplification that promotes prioritized learning for cold-start items, and (3) a hierarchical multi-source graph encoder for robust signal fusion with collaborative signals. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate MoToRec's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both overall and cold-start scenarios. Our work validates that discrete tokenization provides an effective and scalable alternative for mitigating the long-standing cold-start challenge.",

To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver. Experiments show that MoEEdit attains state-of-the-art efficacy and generalization while preserving high specificity and routing stability, with superior compute and memory efficiency. These results establish a robust foundation for scalable, precise knowledge editing in sparse LLMs and underscore the importance of routing-stable interventions.",

Nonetheless, it faces persistent challenges, including the pre-selection of an optimal rank and rank-specific hyper-parameters, as well as the deployment complexity of heterogeneous-rank modules and more sophisticated LoRA derivatives. In this work, we introduce LoRA-Squeeze, a simple and efficient methodology that aims to improve standard LoRA learning by changing LoRA module ranks either post-hoc or dynamically during training}. Our approach posits that it is better to first learn an expressive, higher-rank solution and then compress it, rather than learning a constrained, low-rank solution directly. The method involves fine-tuning with a deliberately high(er) source rank, reconstructing or efficiently approximating the reconstruction of the full weight update matrix, and then using Randomized Singular Value Decomposition (RSVD) to create a new, compressed LoRA module at a lower target rank. Extensive experiments across 13 text and 10 vision-language tasks show that post-hoc compression often produces lower-rank adapters that outperform those trained directly at the target rank, especially if a small number of fine-tuning steps at the target rank is allowed. Moreover, a gradual, in-tuning rank annealing variant of LoRA-Squeeze consistently achieves the best LoRA size-performance trade-off.",

A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances.

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable general-purpose capabilities but often fall short in specialized domains such as medical imaging or geometric problem-solving. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) can enhance performance within a target domain, but it typically causes catastrophic forgetting, limiting its generalization. The central challenge, therefore, is to adapt VLMs to new domains while preserving their general-purpose capabilities. Continual pretraining is effective for expanding knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs), but it is less feasible for VLMs due to prohibitive computational costs and the unavailability of pretraining data for most open-source models. This necessitates efficient post-training adaptation methods. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in preserving general abilities, yet they often fail in domain adaptation scenarios where the model initially lacks sufficient domain knowledge, leading to optimization collapse. To bridge this gap, we propose Reinforced Curriculum Pre-Alignment (RCPA), a novel post-training paradigm that introduces a curriculum-aware progressive modulation mechanism. In the early phase, RCPA applies partial output constraints to safely expose the model to new domain concepts. As the model's domain familiarity increases, training gradually transitions to full generation optimization, refining responses and aligning them with domain-specific preferences. This staged adaptation balances domain knowledge acquisition with the preservation of general multimodal capabilities. Extensive experiments across specialized domains and general benchmarks validate the effectiveness of RCPA, establishing a practical pathway toward building high-performing and domain-adaptive VLMs.",

    "summary": "Diffusion language models generate text through iterative refinement, a process that is often computationally inefficient because many tokens reach stability long before the final denoising step. We introduce a training-free, token-level early stopping approach that identifies convergence independently at each position. Our method leverages lightweight signals derived from the model's predictions and local context to dynamically determine when individual tokens can be finalized. This yields adaptive per-token freezing without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the total number of diffusion steps required. Across diverse benchmarks, spanning mathematical reasoning, general question answering, and scientific understanding, our approach achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains while preserving generation quality.",

    "summary": "Graphs are foundational across domains but remain hard to use without deep expertise. LLMs promise accessible natural language (NL) graph analytics, yet they fail to process industry-scale property graphs effectively and efficiently: such datasets are large, highly heterogeneous, structurally complex, and evolve dynamically. To address this, we devise a novel abstraction for complex multi-query analytics over such graphs. Its key idea is to replace brittle generation of graph queries directly from NL with planning over a Semantic Catalog that describes both the graph schema and the graph operations. Concretely, this induces a clean separation between a Semantic Plane for LLM planning and broader reasoning, and an Execution Plane for deterministic, database-grade query execution over the full dataset and tool implementations. This design yields substantial gains in both token efficiency and task effectiveness even with small-context LLMs. We use this abstraction as the basis of the first LLM-enhanced graph analytics framework called GraphSeek. GraphSeek achieves substantially higher success rates (e.g., 86% over enhanced LangChain) and points toward the next generation of affordable and accessible graph analytics that unify LLM reasoning with database-grade execution over large and complex property graphs.",

    "summary": "The multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem is a fundamental topic in network flow and combinatorial optimization, with broad applications in transportation, communication, and logistics, etc. Nowadays, the rapid expansion of allocation systems has posed challenges for existing optimization engines in balancing optimality and tractability. In this paper, we present Pram, the first ML-based method that leverages the reasoning power of multimodal language models (MLMs) for addressing the trade-off dilemma -- a great need of service providers. As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster). Moreover, Pram exhibits strong robustness (<10\\% performance degradation under link failures or flow bursts), demonstrating MLM's generalization ability to unforeseen events. Pram is objective-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with mainstream allocation systems, providing a practical and scalable solution for future networks.",

    "summary": "While FP8 attention has shown substantial promise in innovations like FlashAttention-3, its integration into the decoding phase of the DeepSeek Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) architecture presents notable challenges. These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

    "summary": "Assortment optimization is a fundamental challenge in modern retail and recommendation systems, where the goal is to select a subset of products that maximizes expected revenue under complex customer choice behaviors. While recent advances in data-driven methods have leveraged historical data to learn and optimize assortments, these approaches typically rely on strong assumptions -- namely, the stability of customer preferences and the correctness of the underlying choice models. However, such assumptions frequently break in real-world scenarios due to preference shifts and model misspecification, leading to poor generalization and revenue loss. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a robust framework for data-driven assortment optimization that accounts for potential distributional shifts in customer choice behavior. Our approach models potential preference shift from a nominal choice model that generates data and seeks to maximize worst-case expected revenue. We first establish the computational tractability of robust assortment planning when the nominal model is known, then advance to the data-driven setting, where we design statistically optimal algorithms that minimize the data requirements while maintaining robustness. Our theoretical analysis provides both upper bounds and matching lower bounds on the sample complexity, offering theoretical guarantees for robust generalization. Notably, we uncover and identify the notion of ``robust item-wise coverage'' as the minimal data requirement to enable sample-efficient robust assortment learning. Our work bridges the gap between robustness and statistical efficiency in assortment learning, contributing new insights and tools for reliable assortment optimization under uncertainty.",

    "summary": "Transformer-based models dominate modern AI workloads but exacerbate memory bottlenecks due to their quadratic attention complexity and ever-growing model sizes. Existing accelerators, such as Groq and Cerebras, mitigate off-chip traffic with large on-chip caches, while algorithmic innovations such as FlashAttention fuse operators to avoid materializing large attention matrices. However, as off-chip traffic decreases, our measurements show that on-chip SRAM accesses account for over 60% of energy in long-sequence workloads, making cache access the new bottleneck. We propose 3D-Flow, a hybrid-bonded, 3D-stacked spatial accelerator that enables register-to-register communication across vertically partitioned PE tiers. Unlike 2D multi-array architectures limited by NoC-based router-to-router transfers, 3D-Flow leverages sub-10 um vertical TSVs to sustain cycle-level operator pipelining with minimal overhead. On top of this architecture, we design 3D-FlashAttention, a fine-grained scheduling method that balances latency across tiers, forming a bubble-free vertical dataflow without on-chip SRAM roundtrips. Evaluations on Transformer workloads (OPT and QWEN models) show that our 3D spatial accelerator reduces 46-93% energy consumption and achieves 1.4x-7.6x speedups compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D designs.",

    "summary": "Accurate retinal vessel segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative analysis of retinal images and computer-aided diagnosis of vascular diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.",

    "summary": "Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted mobile computing from App-centric interactions to system-level autonomous agents. Current implementations predominantly rely on a \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm, which inherits structural vulnerabilities and conflicts with the mobile ecosystem's economic foundations. In this paper, we conduct a systematic security analysis of state-of-the-art mobile agents using Doubao Mobile Assistant as a representative case. We decompose the threat landscape into four dimensions - Agent Identity, External Interface, Internal Reasoning, and Action Execution - revealing critical flaws such as fake App identity, visual spoofing, indirect prompt injection, and unauthorized privilege escalation stemming from a reliance on unstructured visual data.   To address these challenges, we propose Aura, an Agent Universal Runtime Architecture for a clean-slate secure agent OS. Aura replaces brittle GUI scraping with a structured, agent-native interaction model. It adopts a Hub-and-Spoke topology where a privileged System Agent orchestrates intent, sandboxed App Agents execute domain-specific tasks, and the Agent Kernel mediates all communication. The Agent Kernel enforces four defense pillars: (i) cryptographic identity binding via a Global Agent Registry; (ii) semantic input sanitization through a multilayer Semantic Firewall; (iii) cognitive integrity via taint-aware memory and plan-trajectory alignment; and (iv) granular access control with non-deniable auditing. Evaluation on MobileSafetyBench shows that, compared to Doubao, Aura improves low-risk Task Success Rate from roughly 75% to 94.3%, reduces high-risk Attack Success Rate from roughly 40% to 4.4%, and achieves near-order-of-magnitude latency gains. These results demonstrate Aura as a viable, secure alternative to the \"Screen-as-Interface\" paradigm.",

    "summary": "The slow iterative sampling nature remains a major bottleneck for the practical deployment of diffusion and flow-based generative models. While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: it achieves a state-of-the-art FID score of 1.70 in one-step generation on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset, outperforming existing CM-based one-step approaches.",

    "summary": "We introduce Renet, a principled generalization of the Relaxed Lasso to the Elastic Net family of estimators. While, on the one hand, $\\ell_1$-regularization is a standard tool for variable selection in high-dimensional regimes and, on the other hand, the $\\ell_2$ penalty provides stability and solution uniqueness through strict convexity, the standard Elastic Net nevertheless suffers from shrinkage bias that frequently yields suboptimal prediction accuracy. We propose to address this limitation through a framework called \\textit{relaxation}. Existing relaxation implementations rely on naive linear interpolations of penalized and unpenalized solutions, which ignore the non-linear geometry that characterizes the entire regularization path and risk violating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Renet addresses these limitations by enforcing sign consistency through an adaptive relaxation procedure that dynamically dispatches between convex blending and efficient sub-path refitting. Furthermore, we identify and formalize a unique synergy between relaxation and the ``One-Standard-Error'' rule: relaxation serves as a robust debiasing mechanism, allowing practitioners to leverage the parsimony of the 1-SE rule without the traditional loss in predictive fidelity. Our theoretical framework incorporates automated stability safeguards for ultra-high dimensional regimes and is supported by a comprehensive benchmarking suite across 20 synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that Renet consistently outperforms the standard Elastic Net and provides a more robust alternative to the Adaptive Elastic Net in high-dimensional, low signal-to-noise ratio and high-multicollinearity regimes. By leveraging an adaptive solver backend, Renet delivers these statistical gains while offering a computational profile that remains competitive with state-of-the-art coordinate descent implementations.",

    "summary": "Agentic coding requires agents to effectively interact with runtime environments, e.g., command line interfaces (CLI), so as to complete tasks like resolving dependency issues, fixing system problems, etc. But it remains underexplored how such environment-intensive tasks can be obtained at scale to enhance agents' capabilities. To address this, based on an analogy between the Dockerfile and the agentic task, we propose to employ agents to simulate and explore environment histories, guided by execution feedback. By tracing histories of a healthy environment, its state can be inverted to an earlier one with runtime failures, from which a task can be derived by packing the buggy state and the corresponding error messages. With our method, named CLI-Gym, a total of 1,655 environment-intensive tasks are derived, being the largest collection of its kind. Moreover, with curated successful trajectories, our fine-tuned model, named LiberCoder, achieves substantial absolute improvements of +21.1% (to 46.1%) on Terminal-Bench, outperforming various strong baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first public pipeline for scalable derivation of environment-intensive tasks.",

    "summary": "Generative molecular optimization aims to design molecules with properties surpassing those of existing compounds. However, such candidates are rare and expensive to evaluate, yielding sample efficiency essential. Additionally, surrogate models introduced to predict molecule evaluations, suffer from distribution shift as optimization drives candidates increasingly out-of-distribution. To address these challenges, we introduce Joint Self-Improvement, which benefits from (i) a joint generative-predictive model and (ii) a self-improving sampling scheme. The former aligns the generator with the surrogate, alleviating distribution shift, while the latter biases the generative part of the joint model using the predictive one to efficiently generate optimized molecules at inference-time. Experiments across offline and online molecular optimization benchmarks demonstrate that Joint Self-Improvement outperforms state-of-the-art methods under limited evaluation budgets.",

    "title": "Deep Learning-based Method for Expressing Knowledge Boundary of Black-Box LLM",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, however, the emergence of content generation distortion (hallucination) limits their practical applications. The core cause of hallucination lies in LLMs' lack of awareness regarding their stored internal knowledge, preventing them from expressing their knowledge state on questions beyond their internal knowledge boundaries, as humans do. However, existing research on knowledge boundary expression primarily focuses on white-box LLMs, leaving methods suitable for black-box LLMs which offer only API access without revealing internal parameters-largely unexplored. Against this backdrop, this paper proposes LSCL (LLM-Supervised Confidence Learning), a deep learning-based method for expressing the knowledge boundaries of black-box LLMs. Based on the knowledge distillation framework, this method designs a deep learning model. Taking the input question, output answer, and token probability from a black-box LLM as inputs, it constructs a mapping between the inputs and the model' internal knowledge state, enabling the quantification and expression of the black-box LLM' knowledge boundaries. Experiments conducted on diverse public datasets and with multiple prominent black-box LLMs demonstrate that LSCL effectively assists black-box LLMs in accurately expressing their knowledge boundaries. It significantly outperforms existing baseline models on metrics such as accuracy and recall rate. Furthermore, considering scenarios where some black-box LLMs do not support access to token probability, an adaptive alternative method is proposed. The performance of this alternative approach is close to that of LSCL and surpasses baseline models.",

Large language models (LLMs) offer natural-language explanations alongside predictions, but most work focuses on binary evaluation, and explanations often lack semantic consistency with Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. We propose VulReaD, a knowledge-graph-guided approach for vulnerability reasoning and detection that moves beyond binary classification toward CWE-level reasoning. VulReaD leverages a security knowledge graph (KG) as a semantic backbone and uses a strong teacher LLM to generate CWE-consistent contrastive reasoning supervision, enabling student model training without manual annotations. Students are fine-tuned with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) to encourage taxonomy-aligned reasoning while suppressing unsupported explanations. Across three real-world datasets, VulReaD improves binary F1 by 8-10% and multi-class classification by 30% Macro-F1 and 18% Micro-F1 compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that LLMs outperform deep learning baselines in binary detection and that KG-guided reasoning enhances CWE coverage and interpretability.",

    "summary": "Existing forgery detection methods are often limited to uni-modal or bi-modal settings, failing to handle the interleaved text, images, and videos prevalent in real-world misinformation. To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \\textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.",

To ensure evaluation reliability, we employ a multi-judge protocol using diverse LLMs from different providers, achieving high inter-judge reliability. We compare existing ISD agents with novel agents grounded in classical ISD theories such as ADDIE, Dick \\& Carey, and Rapid Prototyping ISD. Experiments on 1,017 test scenarios demonstrate that integrating classical ISD frameworks with modern ReAct-style reasoning achieves the highest performance, outperforming both pure theory-based agents and technique-only approaches.

Tax law exemplifies these challenges, as correct answers require exact statutory citation, structured legal argumentation, and numerical accuracy under rigid grading schemes. We algorithmically generate SteuerEx, the first open benchmark derived from authentic German university tax law examinations. SteuerEx comprises 115 expert-validated examination questions spanning six core tax law domains and multiple academic levels, and employs a statement-level, partial-credit evaluation framework that closely mirrors real examination practice. We further present SteuerLLM, a domain-adapted LLM for German tax law trained on a large-scale synthetic dataset generated from authentic examination material using a controlled retrieval-augmented pipeline. SteuerLLM (28B parameters) consistently outperforms general-purpose instruction-tuned models of comparable size and, in several cases, substantially larger systems, demonstrating that domain-specific data and architectural adaptation are more decisive than parameter scale for performance on realistic legal reasoning tasks. All benchmark data, training datasets, model weights, and evaluation code are released openly to support reproducible research in domain-specific legal artificial intelligence.

    "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

However, existing methods often suffer from noisy and conflicting update signals. In this research, we propose C-MOP (Cluster-based Momentum Optimized Prompting), a framework that stabilizes optimization via Boundary-Aware Contrastive Sampling (BACS) and Momentum-Guided Semantic Clustering (MGSC). Specifically, BACS utilizes batch-level information to mine tripartite features--Hard Negatives, Anchors, and Boundary Pairs--to precisely characterize the typical representation and decision boundaries of positive and negative prompt samples. To resolve semantic conflicts, MGSC introduces a textual momentum mechanism with temporal decay that distills persistent consensus from fluctuating gradients across iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that C-MOP consistently outperforms SOTA baselines like PromptWizard and ProTeGi, yielding average gains of 1.58% and 3.35%. Notably, C-MOP enables a general LLM with 3B activated parameters to surpass a 70B domain-specific dense LLM, highlighting its effectiveness in driving precise prompt evolution.

Standard machine learning intuition suggests that training with more unique training samples yields better generalization. Counterintuitively, we show that SFT benefits from repetition: under a fixed update budget, training for more epochs on smaller datasets outperforms single-epoch training on larger datasets. On AIME'24/25 and GPQA benchmarks, Olmo3-7B trained for 128 epochs on 400 samples outperforms the equivalent 1 epoch on 51200 samples by 12-26 percentage points, with no additional catastrophic forgetting. We find that training token accuracy reliably signals when repetition has saturated; improvements from additional epochs plateau at full memorization, a pattern consistent across all settings. These findings provide a practical approach for reasoning SFT, where scaling epochs with token accuracy as a stopping criterion can replace expensive undirected data scaling. We pose the repetition advantage, where full memorization coincides with improved generalization, as a new open problem for the community in understanding the training dynamics of large language models.",

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level. Furthermore, we establish non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence guarantees via a policy-dual Lyapunov argument. Experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.",

In addition, our extensive ablation study shows the importance of core techniques used in the proposed method. We believe that our efficient algorithm shows the potential of model-free reinforcement learning in domains traditionally dominated by search-based methods.",

    "title": "Why Does RL Generalize Better Than SFT? A Data-Centric Perspective on VLM Post-Training",
    "summary": "The adaptation of large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through post-training reveals a pronounced generalization gap: models fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning (RL) consistently achieve superior out-of-distribution (OOD) performance compared to those trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). This paper posits a data-centric explanation for this phenomenon, contending that RL's generalization advantage arises from an implicit data filtering mechanism that inherently prioritizes medium-difficulty training samples. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty. Experiments show that DC-SFT not only substantially enhances OOD generalization over standard SFT, but also surpasses the performance of RL-based training, all while providing greater stability and computational efficiency. This work offers a data-centric account of the OOD generalization gap in VLMs and establishes a more efficient pathway to achieving robust generalization.

    "title": "PRISM: Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model",
    "summary": "Generative sequence modeling faces a fundamental tension between the expressivity of Transformers and the efficiency of linear sequence models. Existing efficient architectures are theoretically bounded by shallow, single-step linear updates, while powerful iterative methods like Test-Time Training (TTT) break hardware parallelism due to state-dependent gradients. We propose PRISM (Parallel Residual Iterative Sequence Model) to resolve this tension. PRISM introduces a solver-inspired inductive bias that captures key structural properties of multi-step refinement in a parallelizable form. We employ a Write-Forget Decoupling strategy that isolates non-linearity within the injection operator. To bypass the serial dependency of explicit solvers, PRISM utilizes a two-stage proxy architecture: a short-convolution anchors the initial residual using local history energy, while a learned predictor estimates the refinement updates directly from the input. This design distills structural patterns associated with iterative correction into a parallelizable feedforward operator. Theoretically, we prove that this formulation achieves Rank-$L$ accumulation, structurally expanding the update manifold beyond the single-step Rank-$1$ bottleneck. Empirically, it achieves comparable performance to explicit optimization methods while achieving 174x higher throughput.",

    "summary": "Machine learning models are increasingly present in our everyday lives; as a result, they become targets of adversarial attackers seeking to manipulate the systems we interact with. A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.",

But recent evidence shows that it can simultaneously degrade safety alignment and increase jailbreak success rates. We propose SafeThink, a lightweight inference-time defense that treats safety recovery as a satisficing constraint rather than a maximization objective. SafeThink monitors the evolving reasoning trace with a safety reward model and conditionally injects an optimized short corrective prefix (\"Wait, think safely\") only when the safety threshold is violated. In our evaluations across six open-source MLRMs and four jailbreak benchmarks (JailbreakV-28K, Hades, FigStep, and MM-SafetyBench), SafeThink reduces attack success rates by 30-60% (e.g., LlamaV-o1: 63.33% to 5.74% on JailbreakV-28K, R1-Onevision: 69.07% to 5.65% on Hades) while preserving reasoning performance (MathVista accuracy: 65.20% to 65.00%). A key empirical finding from our experiments is that safety recovery is often only a few steering steps away: intervening in the first 1-3 reasoning steps typically suffices to redirect the full generation toward safe completions.",

However, progress in this area has been limited by the lack of large, diverse datasets necessary to address critical challenges such as generalization to new users and robustness to shifts in factors like footwear or walking speed. The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy. Overall, the competition showcased strong solutions, but persistent challenges in generalizing to unfamiliar footwear highlight a critical area for future work.",

By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%. Our method outperforms gradient-based attribution and LLM-judge baselines while being over 10 times cheaper than both. This in-the-wild model organism - emerging from contaminated preference data rather than deliberate injection - provides a realistic benchmark for safety techniques.",

We formulate this problem as a classical gradient-based optimisation. First, we propose a simple algorithm to achieve end-to-end differentiability of a given (frozen) LM and then find optimised prompts via gradient descent. Our central insight is to view LMs as functions operating on sequences of distributions over tokens (rather than the traditional view as functions on sequences of tokens). Our experiments and ablations demonstrate that our DLM-powered inversion can reliably and efficiently optimise prompts of lengths $10$ and $80$ for targets of length $20$, for several white-box LMs (out-of-the-box).",

These documents are heterogeneous collections such as emails, legal texts, and spreadsheets compiled into single PDFs, where semantic ordering signals are unreliable. We compare five methods, including pointer networks, seq2seq transformers, and specialized pairwise ranking models. The best performing approach successfully reorders documents up to 15 pages, with Kendall's tau ranging from 0.95 for short documents (2-5 pages) to 0.72 for 15 page documents. We observe two unexpected failures: seq2seq transformers fail to generalize on long documents (Kendall's tau drops from 0.918 on 2-5 pages to 0.014 on 21-25 pages), and curriculum learning underperforms direct training by 39% on long documents. Ablation studies suggest learned positional encodings are one contributing factor to seq2seq failure, though the degradation persists across all encoding variants, indicating multiple interacting causes. Attention pattern analysis reveals that short and long documents require fundamentally different ordering strategies, explaining why curriculum learning fails. Model specialization achieves substantial improvements on longer documents (+0.21 tau).",

Our approach employs string matching based on suffix arrays that scales well with corpus size. To mitigate the combinatorial explosion induced by the semantic relaxation of queries, our method is built on two key algorithmic ideas: fast exact lookup enabled by a disk-aware design, and dynamic corpus-aware pruning. We theoretically show that the proposed method suppresses exponential growth in the search space with respect to query length by leveraging statistical properties of natural language. In experiments on FineWeb-Edu (Lozhkov et al., 2024) (1.4T tokens), we show that our method achieves significantly lower search latency than existing methods: infini-gram (Liu et al., 2024), infini-gram mini (Xu et al., 2025), and SoftMatcha (Deguchi et al., 2025).

This design enables a parallel optimize-and-approximate framework in which the Hessian-inverse approximation is updated synchronously with the stochastic inner optimization, reusing gradient information at negligible additional cost. Our main theoretical contribution establishes high-probability error bounds and sample complexity guarantees for NHGD that match those of state-of-the-art optimize-then-approximate methods, while significantly reducing computational time overhead.

    "summary": "A narrated e-book combines synchronized audio with digital text, highlighting the currently spoken word or sentence during playback. This format supports early literacy and assists individuals with reading challenges, while also allowing general readers to seamlessly switch between reading and listening. With the emergence of natural-sounding neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology, several commercial services have been developed to leverage these technology for converting standard text e-books into high-quality narrated e-books. However, no open-source solutions currently exist to perform this task. In this paper, we present Calliope, an open-source framework designed to fill this gap. Our method leverages state-of-the-art open-source TTS to convert a text e-book into a narrated e-book in the EPUB 3 Media Overlay format. The method offers several innovative steps: audio timestamps are captured directly during TTS, ensuring exact synchronization between narration and text highlighting; the publisher's original typography, styling, and embedded media are strictly preserved; and the entire pipeline operates offline. This offline capability eliminates recurring API costs, mitigates privacy concerns, and avoids copyright compliance issues associated with cloud-based services. The framework currently supports the state-of-the-art open-source TTS systems XTTS-v2 and Chatterbox. A potential alternative approach involves first generating narration via TTS and subsequently synchronizing it with the text using forced alignment. However, while our method ensures exact synchronization, our experiments show that forced alignment introduces drift between the audio and text highlighting significant enough to degrade the reading experience.

Based on the notion of \\textit{local ranking median}, we introduce the concept of \\textit{consensus ranking distribution} ($\\crd$), a sparse mixture model of Dirac masses on $\\mathfrak{S}_n$, in order to approximate a ranking distribution with small distortion from a mass transportation perspective. We prove that by choosing the popular Kendall $τ$ distance as the cost function, the optimal distortion can be expressed as a function of pairwise probabilities, paving the way for the development of efficient learning methods that do not suffer from the lack of vector space structure on $\\mathfrak{S}_n$. In particular, we propose a top-down tree-structured statistical algorithm that allows for the progressive refinement of a CRD based on ranking data, from the Dirac mass at a Kemeny median at the root of the tree to the empirical ranking data distribution itself at the end of the tree's exhaustive growth. In addition to the theoretical arguments developed, the relevance of the algorithm is empirically supported by various numerical experiments.",

    "summary": "Reward models learned from human preferences are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback, yet they are often vulnerable to reward hacking due to noisy annotations and systematic biases such as response length or style. We propose Bayesian Non-Negative Reward Model (BNRM), a principled reward modeling framework that integrates non-negative factor analysis into Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model. BNRM represents rewards through a sparse, non-negative latent factor generative process that operates at two complementary levels: instance-specific latent variables induce disentangled reward representations, while sparsity over global latent factors acts as an implicit debiasing mechanism that suppresses spurious correlations. Together, this disentanglement-then-debiasing structure enables robust uncertainty-aware reward learning. To scale BNRM to modern LLMs, we develop an amortized variational inference network conditioned on deep model representations, allowing efficient end-to-end training. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that BNRM substantially mitigates reward over-optimization, improves robustness under distribution shifts, and yields more interpretable reward decompositions than strong baselines.",

    "summary": "In this report, we introduce pplx-embed, a family of multilingual embedding models that employ multi-stage contrastive learning on a diffusion-pretrained language model backbone for web-scale retrieval. By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents. These results validate the models' effectiveness in production environments where retrieval quality and efficiency are critical at scale.",

In this work, we propose a novel method for representing textual documents that facilitates the incorporation of information from a knowledge base. Our approach, Text Encoding with Graph (TEG), processes documents by extracting structured information in the form of a graph and encoding both the text and the graph for classification purposes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that this hybrid representation enhances misinformation detection performance compared to using language models alone. Furthermore, we introduce TEGRA, an extension of our framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge, further enhancing classification accuracy in most cases.",

    "summary": "The task of graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD) is to identify anomalous graphs that deviate significantly from the majority of graphs in a dataset. While deep GLAD methods have shown promising performance, their black-box nature limits their reliability and deployment in real-world applications. Although some recent methods have made attempts to provide explanations for anomaly detection results, they either provide explanations without referencing normal graphs, or rely on abstract latent vectors as prototypes rather than concrete graphs from the dataset. To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that ProtoGLAD achieves competitive anomaly detection performance compared to state-of-the-art GLAD methods while providing better human-interpretable prototype-based explanations.",

    "summary": "As LLM-based agents increasingly operate in high-stakes domains with real-world consequences, ensuring their behavioral safety becomes paramount. The dominant oversight paradigm, LLM-as-a-Judge, faces a fundamental dilemma: how can probabilistic systems reliably supervise other probabilistic systems without inheriting their failure modes? We argue that formal verification offers a principled escape from this dilemma, yet its adoption has been hindered by a critical bottleneck: the translation from natural language requirements to formal specifications. This paper bridges this gap by proposing , a neuro-symbolic framework that employs a bidirectional Formal-of-Thought architecture: LLMs serve as specification compilers that top-down decompose high-level human intent into atomic, verifiable constraints, then bottom-up prove compliance using Dafny specifications and Z3 Satisfiability modulo theories solving, which produces mathematical guarantees rather than probabilistic scores. We validate across three benchmarks spanning behavioral safety, multi-domain constraint adherence, and agentic upward deception detection. Experiments on 7 agent models demonstrate that achieves an average improvement of 16.6% over LLM-as-a-Judge baselines, enables weak-to-strong generalization where a 7B judge achieves over 90% accuracy detecting deception from 72B agents, and provides near-linear safety improvement through iterative refinement.",

    "summary": "Automatically generating agentic workflows -- executable operator graphs or codes that orchestrate reasoning, verification, and repair -- has become a practical way to solve complex tasks beyond what single-pass LLM generation can reliably handle. Yet what constitutes a good workflow depends heavily on the task distribution and the available operators. Under domain shift, current systems typically rely on iterative workflow refinement to discover a feasible workflow from a large workflow space, incurring high iteration costs and yielding unstable, domain-specific behavior. In response, we internalize a decompose-recompose-decide mechanism into an open-source LLM for cross-domain workflow generation. To decompose, we learn a compact set of reusable workflow capabilities across diverse domains. To recompose, we map each input task to a sparse composition over these bases to generate a task-specific workflow in a single pass. To decide, we attribute the success or failure of workflow generation to counterfactual contributions from learned capabilities, thereby capturing which capabilities actually drive success by their marginal effects. Across stringent multi-domain, cross-domain, and unseen-domain evaluations, our 1-pass generator surpasses SOTA refinement baselines that consume 20 iterations, while substantially reducing generation latency and cost.",

    "summary": "Query-based 3D scene instance segmentation from point clouds has attained notable performance. However, existing methods suffer from the query initialization dilemma due to the sparse nature of point clouds and rely on computationally intensive attention mechanisms in query decoders. We accordingly introduce LaSSM, prioritizing simplicity and efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. Specifically, we propose a hierarchical semantic-spatial query initializer to derive the query set from superpoints by considering both semantic cues and spatial distribution, achieving comprehensive scene coverage and accelerated convergence. We further present a coordinate-guided state space model (SSM) decoder that progressively refines queries. The novel decoder features a local aggregation scheme that restricts the model to focus on geometrically coherent regions and a spatial dual-path SSM block to capture underlying dependencies within the query set by integrating associated coordinates information. Our design enables efficient instance prediction, avoiding the incorporation of noisy information and reducing redundant computation. LaSSM ranks first place on the latest ScanNet++ V2 leaderboard, outperforming the previous best method by 2.5% mAP with only 1/3 FLOPs, demonstrating its superiority in challenging large-scale scene instance segmentation. LaSSM also achieves competitive performance on ScanNet, ScanNet200, S3DIS and ScanNet++ V1 benchmarks with less computational cost. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results validate the effectiveness of our design. The code and weights are available at https://github.com/RayYoh/LaSSM.",

This paper introduces the DFIC dataset, a novel comprehensive facial image dataset comprising around 58,000 annotated images and 2706 videos of more than 1000 subjects, that cover a broad range of non-compliant conditions, in addition to compliant portraits. Our dataset provides a more balanced demographic distribution than the existing public datasets, with one partition that is nearly uniformly distributed, facilitating the development of automated ICAO compliance verification methods.   Using DFIC, we fine-tuned a novel method that heavily relies on spatial attention mechanisms for the automatic validation of ICAO compliance requirements, and we have compared it with the state-of-the-art aimed at ICAO compliance verification, demonstrating improved results. DFIC dataset is now made public (https://github.com/visteam-isr-uc/DFIC) for the training and validation of new models, offering an unprecedented diversity of faces, that will improve both robustness and adaptability to the intrinsically diverse combinations of faces and props that can be presented to the validation system. These results emphasize the potential of DFIC to enhance automated ICAO compliance methods but it can also be used in many other applications that aim to improve the security, privacy, and fairness of facial recognition systems.",

    "summary": "Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in numerous real-world applications, yet existing models remain constrained by their reliance on a limited historical context. This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead. These results highlight GTR as an efficient and general solution for enhancing global periodicity modeling in MTSF tasks. Code is available at this repository: https://github.com/macovaseas/GTR.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have revealed that when LLMs are appropriately prompted and configured, they demonstrate mixed results. Such results often meet or exceed the baseline performance. However, these comparisons have two primary issues. First, they mostly considered only reliability as a comparison metric and selected a few LLMs (such as Codex and ChatGPT) for comparision. This paper proposes a comprehensive code quality assessment framework called Programmatic Excellence via LLM Iteration (PELLI). PELLI is an iterative analysis-based process that upholds high-quality code changes. We extended the state-of-the-art by performing a comprehensive evaluation that generates quantitative metrics for analyzing three primary nonfunctional requirements (such as maintainability, performance, and reliability) while selecting five popular LLMs. For PELLI's applicability, we selected three application domains while following Python coding standards. Following this framework, practitioners can ensure harmonious integration between LLMs and human developers, ensuring that their potential is fully realized. PELLI can serve as a practical guide for developers aiming to leverage LLMs while adhering to recognized quality standards. This study's outcomes are crucial for advancing LLM technologies in real-world applications, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of where these LLMs excel and where they require further refinement. Overall, based on three nonfunctional requirements, we have found that GPT-4T and Gemini performed slightly better. We also found that prompt design can influence the overall code quality. In addition, each application domain demonstrated high and low scores across various metrics, and even within the same metrics across different prompts.",

    "summary": "State-space language models such as Mamba and gated linear attention (GLA) offer efficient alternatives to transformers due to their linear complexity and parallel training, but often lack the expressivity and robust state-tracking needed for complex reasoning. We address these limitations by reframing sequence modelling through a probabilistic lens, using Bayesian filters as a core primitive. While classical filters such as Kalman filters provide principled state estimation and uncertainty tracking, they are typically viewed as inherently sequential. We show that reparameterising the Kalman filter in information form enables its updates to be computed via an associative scan, allowing efficient parallel training. Building on this insight, we introduce the Kalman Linear Attention (KLA) layer, a neural sequence-modelling primitive that performs time-parallel probabilistic inference while maintaining explicit belief-state uncertainty. KLA offers strictly more expressive nonlinear updates and gating than GLA variants while retaining their computational advantages. On language modelling tasks, KLA matches or outperforms modern SSMs and GLAs across representative discrete token-manipulation and state-tracking benchmarks.",

Boltzmann Generators (BGs) address this by combining exact-likelihood generative models with importance sampling, but their practical scalability is limited. Meanwhile, coarse-grained surrogates enable the modeling of larger systems by reducing effective dimensionality, yet often lack the reweighting process required to ensure asymptotically correct statistics. In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model. Crucially, we show that this PMF can be efficiently learned from rapidly converged data via force matching. Our results demonstrate that CG-BGs faithfully capture complex interactions mediated by explicit solvent within highly reduced representations, establishing a scalable pathway for the unbiased sampling of larger molecular systems.",

We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.   Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.   Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches. B3IT reduces costs by $30\\times$ compared to existing methods, while operating in a strict black-box setting.",

    "summary": "Deep learning models trained in a supervised setting have revolutionized audio and speech processing. However, their performance inherently depends on the quantity of human-annotated data, making them costly to scale and prone to poor generalization under unseen conditions. To address these challenges, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm, leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn relevant representations. The application of SSL for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has been extensively studied, but research on other downstream tasks, notably Speaker Recognition (SR), remains in its early stages. This work describes major SSL instance-invariance frameworks (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo, and DINO), initially developed for computer vision, along with their adaptation to SR. Various SSL methods for SR, proposed in the literature and built upon these frameworks, are also presented. An extensive review of these approaches is then conducted: (1) the effect of the main hyperparameters of SSL frameworks is investigated; (2) the role of SSL components is studied (e.g., data-augmentation, projector, positive sampling); and (3) SSL frameworks are evaluated on SR with in-domain and out-of-domain data, using a consistent experimental setup, and a comprehensive comparison of SSL methods from the literature is provided. Specifically, DINO achieves the best downstream performance and effectively models intra-speaker variability, although it is highly sensitive to hyperparameters and training conditions, while SimCLR and MoCo provide robust alternatives that effectively capture inter-speaker variability and are less prone to collapse. This work aims to highlight recent trends and advancements, identifying current challenges in the field.",

To address this, we propose Unified Memory Extraction and Management (UMEM), a self-evolving agent framework that jointly optimizes a Large Language Model to simultaneous extract and manage memories. To mitigate overfitting to specific instances, we introduce Semantic Neighborhood Modeling and optimize the model with a neighborhood-level marginal utility reward via GRPO. This approach ensures memory generalizability by evaluating memory utility across clusters of semantically related queries. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that UMEM significantly outperforms highly competitive baselines, achieving up to a 10.67% improvement in multi-turn interactive tasks. Futhermore, UMEM maintains a monotonic growth curve during continuous evolution. Codes and models will be publicly released.",

    "summary": "Theory of Mind (ToM) assesses whether models can infer hidden mental states such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, which is essential for natural social interaction. Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction. We also design two intervention approaches: Slow-to-Fast (S2F) adaptive reasoning and Think-to-Match (T2M) shortcut prevention to further verify and mitigate the problems. With all results, our study highlights the advancement of LRMs in formal reasoning (e.g., math, code) cannot be fully transferred to ToM, a typical task in social reasoning. We conclude that achieving robust ToM requires developing unique capabilities beyond existing reasoning methods.",

    "summary": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual generation. Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability. To bridge this gap, we propose a training-free attention intervention strategy. Ultimately, $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ establishes a rigorous standard for $\\textit{GFI}$, guiding the field beyond knowledge utilization toward dynamic, general-purpose reasoning.

    "summary": "Reliable surface completion from sparse point clouds underpins many applications spanning content creation and robotics. While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%. Overall, this work is a case study on how diffusion model behavior can be understood and guided based on mechanistic analysis, linking a circuit-level cross-attention mechanism to diffusion-dynamics accounts of trajectory bifurcations.",

We pretrain motion time-series models using such synthetic data and evaluate their transfer across diverse downstream HAR tasks. Our results show that synthetic pretraining improves generalisation when mixed with real data or scaled sufficiently. We also demonstrate that large-scale motion-capture pretraining yields only marginal gains due to domain mismatch with wearable signals, clarifying key sim-to-real challenges and the limits and opportunities of synthetic motion data for transferable HAR representations.",

The drift is expressed as a conditional expectation that can be estimated from independent samples without simulating stochastic processes. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \\emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a Föllmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of Föllmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schrödinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.",

We propose HCW-GLB-OMD, which consists of two components: an online mirror descent (OMD)-based estimator and Hessian-based confidence weights to achieve corruption robustness. This is computationally efficient in that it only requires ${O}(1)$ space and time complexity per iteration. Under the self-concordance assumption on the link function, we show a regret bound of $\\tilde{O}\\left( d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(τ_t) \\dotμ_{t,\\star}} + d^2 g_{\\max} κ+ d κC \\right)$, where $\\dotμ_{t,\\star}$ is the slope of $μ$ around the optimal arm at time $t$, $g(τ_t)$'s are potentially exogenously time-varying dispersions (e.g., $g(τ_t) = σ_t^2$ for heteroskedastic linear bandits, $g(τ_t) = 1$ for Bernoulli and Poisson), $g_{\\max} = \\max_{t \\in [T]} g(τ_t)$ is the maximum dispersion, and $C \\geq 0$ is the total corruption budget of the adversary. We complement this with a lower bound of $\\tildeΩ(d \\sqrt{\\sum_t g(τ_t) \\dotμ_{t,\\star}} + d C)$, unifying previous problem-specific lower bounds. Thus, our algorithm achieves, up to a $κ$-factor in the corruption term, instance-wise minimax optimality simultaneously across various instances of heteroskedastic GLBs with adversarial corruptions.",

    "summary": "Rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) are widely used in large language models to encode token positions through multiplicative rotations, yet their behavior at long context lengths remains poorly characterized. In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.   Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.   Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.   We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds. Notably, models that violate the stability bound exhibit attention collapse and long-range degradation, while attempts to scale beyond one million tokens encounter a hard precision wall independent of architecture or training.",

Standard decoding follows a greedy rule: unmask the most confident positions, yet this local choice can lock the model into a suboptimal unmasking order, especially on reasoning-heavy prompts. We present SOAR, a training-free decoding algorithm that adapts its behavior to the model's uncertainty. When confidence is low, SOAR briefly widens the search over alternative unmasking decisions to avoid premature commitments; when confidence is high, it collapses the search and decodes many positions in parallel to reduce the number of denoising iterations.

    "summary": "Multi-task policy search is a challenging problem because policies are required to generalize beyond training cases. Curriculum learning has proven to be effective in this setting, as it introduces complexity progressively. However, designing effective curricula is labor-intensive and requires extensive domain expertise. LLM-based curriculum generation has only recently emerged as a potential solution, but was limited to operate in static, offline modes without leveraging real-time feedback from the optimizer. Here we propose an interactive LLM-assisted framework for online curriculum generation, where the LLM adaptively designs training cases based on real-time feedback from the evolutionary optimization process. We investigate how different feedback modalities, ranging from numeric metrics alone to combinations with plots and behavior visualizations, influence the LLM ability to generate meaningful curricula. Through a 2D robot navigation case study, tackled with genetic programming as optimizer, we evaluate our approach against static LLM-generated curricula and expert-designed baselines. We show that interactive curriculum generation outperforms static approaches, with multimodal feedback incorporating both progression plots and behavior visualizations yielding performance competitive with expert-designed curricula. This work contributes to understanding how LLMs can serve as interactive curriculum designers for embodied AI systems, with potential extensions to broader evolutionary robotics applications.",

    "summary": "Systematic reviews and meta-analyses rely on converting narrative articles into structured, numerically grounded study records. Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), it remains unclear whether they can meet the structural requirements of this process, which hinge on preserving roles, methods, and effect-size attribution across documents rather than on recognizing isolated entities. We propose a structural, diagnostic framework that evaluates LLM-based evidence extraction as a progression of schema-constrained queries with increasing relational and numerical complexity, enabling precise identification of failure points beyond atom-level extraction. Using a manually curated corpus spanning five scientific domains, together with a unified query suite and evaluation protocol, we evaluate two state-of-the-art LLMs under both per-document and long-context, multi-document input regimes. Across domains and models, performance remains moderate for single-property queries but degrades sharply once tasks require stable binding between variables, roles, statistical methods, and effect sizes. Full meta-analytic association tuples are extracted with near-zero reliability, and long-context inputs further exacerbate these failures. Downstream aggregation amplifies even minor upstream errors, rendering corpus-level statistics unreliable. Our analysis shows that these limitations stem not from entity recognition errors, but from systematic structural breakdowns, including role reversals, cross-analysis binding drift, instance compression in dense result sections, and numeric misattribution, indicating that current LLMs lack the structural fidelity, relational binding, and numerical grounding required for automated meta-analysis.

Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.",

    "summary": "Block-based programming environments such as Scratch play a central role in low-code education, yet evaluating the capabilities of AI agents to construct programs through Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remains underexplored. We introduce ScratchWorld, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal GUI agents on program-by-construction tasks in Scratch. Grounded in the Use-Modify-Create pedagogical framework, ScratchWorld comprises 83 curated tasks spanning four distinct problem categories: Create, Debug, Extend, and Compute. To rigorously diagnose the source of agent failures, the benchmark employs two complementary interaction modes: primitive mode requires fine-grained drag-and-drop manipulation to directly assess visuomotor control, while composite mode uses high-level semantic APIs to disentangle program reasoning from GUI execution. To ensure reliable assessment, we propose an execution-based evaluation protocol that validates the functional correctness of the constructed Scratch programs through runtime tests within the browser environment. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art multimodal language models and GUI agents reveal a substantial reasoning--acting gap, highlighting persistent challenges in fine-grained GUI manipulation despite strong planning capabilities.",

    "title": "Domain Knowledge Guided Bayesian Optimization For Autonomous Alignment Of Complex Scientific Instruments",
    "summary": "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a powerful tool for optimizing complex non-linear systems. However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows. Our results demonstrate a generalizable paradigm: leveraging physical insight to transform high-dimensional, coupled optimization problems into simpler representations can enable rapid and robust automated tuning for consistent high performance while still retaining current optimization algorithms.",

    "summary": "To develop socially intelligent AI, existing approaches typically model human behavioral dimensions (e.g., affective, cognitive, or social attributes) in isolation. Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces. We also validate HARPO against recent RL methods, where it achieves the most consistently strong performance across behavioral tasks.",

    "summary": "This white paper presents a critical synthesis of the recent breakthrough in nonuniformly elliptic regularity theory and the burgeoning field of neurosymbolic large reasoning models (LRMs). We explore the resolution of the long-standing sharp growth rate conjecture in Schauder theory, achieved by Cristiana De Filippis and Giuseppe Mingione, which identifies the exact threshold $q/p < 1 + α/n$ for gradient Hölder continuity. Central to this mathematical achievement is the ``ghost equation'' methodology, a sophisticated auxiliary derivation that bypasses the non-differentiability of classical Euler-Lagrange systems. We propose that the next era of mathematical discovery lies in the integration of these pure analytical constructs with LRMs grounded in topos theory and formal verification frameworks such as Safe and Typed Chain-of-Thought (PC-CoT). By modeling the reasoning process as a categorical colimit in a slice topos, we demonstrate how LRMs can autonomously navigate the ``Dark Side'' of the calculus of variations, providing machine-checkable proofs for regularity bounds in complex, multi-phase physical systems.",

    "summary": "Medical foundation models have shown promise in controlled benchmarks, yet widespread deployment remains hindered by reliance on task-specific fine-tuning. Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment. In collaborative workflows, AI assistance enabled non-experts to surpass unassisted experts while improving management appropriateness. Finally, we show that DermFM-Zero's latent representations are interpretable: sparse autoencoders unsupervisedly disentangle clinically meaningful concepts that outperform predefined-vocabulary approaches and enable targeted suppression of artifact-induced biases, enhancing robustness without retraining. These findings demonstrate that a foundation model can provide effective, safe, and transparent zero-shot clinical decision support.",

    "summary": "We study same-source multi-view learning and adversarial robustness for next-day direction prediction with financial image representations. On Shanghai Gold Exchange (SGE) spot gold data (2005-2025), we construct two window-aligned views from each rolling window: an OHLCV-rendered price/volume chart and a technical-indicator matrix. To ensure reliable evaluation, we adopt leakage-resistant time-block splits with embargo and use Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). We find that results depend strongly on the label-noise regime: we apply an ex-post minimum-movement filter that discards samples with realized next-day absolute return below tau to define evaluation subsets with reduced near-zero label ambiguity. This induces a non-monotonic data-noise trade-off that can reveal predictive signal but eventually increases variance as sample size shrinks; the filter is used for offline benchmark construction rather than an inference-time decision rule. In the stabilized subsets, fusion is regime dependent: early fusion by channel stacking can exhibit negative transfer, whereas late fusion with dual encoders and a fusion head provides the dominant clean-performance gains; cross-view consistency regularization has secondary, backbone-dependent effects. We further evaluate test-time L-infinity perturbations using FGSM and PGD under two threat scenarios: view-constrained attacks that perturb one view and joint attacks that perturb both. We observe severe vulnerability at tiny budgets with strong view asymmetry. Late fusion consistently improves robustness under view-constrained attacks, but joint attacks remain challenging and can still cause substantial worst-case degradation.",

    "summary": "This work addresses the problem of offline safe imitation learning (IL), where the goal is to learn safe and reward-maximizing policies from demonstrations that do not have per-timestep safety cost or reward information. In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.",

    "title": "Can LLMs Cook Jamaican Couscous? A Study of Cultural Novelty in Recipe Generation",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate and shape cultural content, ranging from narrative writing to artistic production. While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.",

Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP), which combines Ulysses and Ring attention mechanisms, has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach for distributed attention computation. However, existing USP implementations suffer from significant inefficiencies including excessive kernel launch overhead and suboptimal computation-communication scheduling. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{FastUSP}, a multi-level optimization framework that integrates compile-level optimization (graph compilation with CUDA Graphs and computation-communication reordering), communication-level optimization (FP8 quantized collective communication), and operator-level optimization (pipelined Ring attention with double buffering). We evaluate FastUSP on FLUX (12B) and Qwen-Image models across 2, 4, and 8 NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPUs. On FLUX, FastUSP achieves consistent \\textbf{1.12$\\times$--1.16$\\times$} end-to-end speedup over baseline USP, with compile-level optimization contributing the dominant improvement. On Qwen-Image, FastUSP achieves \\textbf{1.09$\\times$} speedup on 2 GPUs; on 4--8 GPUs, we identify a PyTorch Inductor compatibility limitation with Ring attention that prevents compile optimization, while baseline USP scales to 1.30$\\times$--1.46$\\times$ of 2-GPU performance.

Text-based parsers often discard layout semantics and introduce unstructured noise, while long-horizon training typically relies on sparse outcome rewards that obscure which retrieval actions actually matter. We propose a visual-native search framework that represents webpages as visual snapshots, allowing agents to leverage layout cues to quickly localize salient evidence and suppress distractors. To learn effectively from these high-dimensional observations, we introduce Information-Aware Credit Assignment (ICA), a post-hoc method that estimates each retrieved snapshot's contribution to the final outcome via posterior analysis and propagates dense learning signals back to key search turns. Integrated with a GRPO-based training pipeline, our approach consistently outperforms text-based baselines on diverse information-seeking benchmarks, providing evidence that visual snapshot grounding with information-level credit assignment alleviates the credit-assignment bottleneck in open-ended web environments.

    "title": "Dynamic Frequency Modulation for Controllable Text-driven Image Generation",
    "summary": "The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.",

    "title": "Generative clinical time series models trained on moderate amounts of patient data are privacy preserving",
    "summary": "Sharing medical data for machine learning model training purposes is often impossible due to the risk of disclosing identifying information about individual patients. Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.",

    "summary": "In the current landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs), the curation of large-scale, high-quality training data is a primary driver of model performance. A key lever is the \\emph{data recipe}, which comprises a data processing pipeline to transform raw sources into training corpora. Despite the growing use of LLMs to automate individual data processing steps, such as data synthesis and filtering, the overall design of data recipes remains largely manual and labor-intensive, requiring substantial human expertise and iteration. To bridge this gap, we formulate \\emph{end-to-end data recipe generation} for LLM adaptation. Given a target benchmark and a pool of available data sources, a model is required to output a complete data recipe that adapts a base LLM to the target task. We present DataChef-32B, which performs online reinforcement learning using a proxy reward that predicts downstream performance for candidate recipes. Across six held-out tasks, DataChef-32B produces practical recipes that reach comparable downstream performance to those curated by human experts. Notably, the recipe from DataChef-32B adapts Qwen3-1.7B-Base to the math domain, achieving 66.7 on AIME'25 and surpassing Qwen3-1.7B. This work sheds new light on automating LLM training and developing self-evolving AI systems.",

    "summary": "Graphs are ubiquitous, and learning on graphs has become a cornerstone in artificial intelligence and data mining communities. Unlike pixel grids in images or sequential structures in language, graphs exhibit a typical non-Euclidean structure with complex interactions among the objects. This paper argues that Riemannian geometry provides a principled and necessary foundation for graph representation learning, and that Riemannian graph learning should be viewed as a unifying paradigm rather than a collection of isolated techniques. While recent studies have explored the integration of graph learning and Riemannian geometry, most existing approaches are limited to a narrow class of manifolds, particularly hyperbolic spaces, and often adopt extrinsic manifold formulations. We contend that the central mission of Riemannian graph learning is to endow graph neural networks with intrinsic manifold structures, which remains underexplored. To advance this perspective, we identify key conceptual and methodological gaps in existing approaches and outline a structured research agenda along three dimensions: manifold type, neural architecture, and learning paradigm. We further discuss open challenges, theoretical foundations, and promising directions that are critical for unlocking the full potential of Riemannian graph learning. This paper aims to provide a coherent viewpoint and to stimulate broader exploration of Riemannian geometry as a foundational framework for future graph learning research.",

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly adopted in remote sensing (RS) and have shown strong performance on tasks such as RS visual grounding (RSVG), RS visual question answering (RSVQA), and multimodal dialogue. However, hallucinations, which are responses inconsistent with the input RS images, severely hinder their deployment in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., emergency management and agricultural monitoring) and remain under-explored in RS. In this work, we present RSHallu, a systematic study with three deliverables: (1) we formalize RS hallucinations with an RS-oriented taxonomy and introduce image-level hallucination to capture RS-specific inconsistencies beyond object-centric errors (e.g., modality, resolution, and scene-level semantics); (2) we build a hallucination benchmark RSHalluEval (2,023 QA pairs) and enable dual-mode checking, supporting high-precision cloud auditing and low-cost reproducible local checking via a compact checker fine-tuned on RSHalluCheck dataset (15,396 QA pairs); and (3) we introduce a domain-tailored dataset RSHalluShield (30k QA pairs) for training-friendly mitigation and further propose training-free plug-and-play strategies, including decoding-time logit correction and RS-aware prompting. Across representative RS-MLLMs, our mitigation improves the hallucination-free rate by up to 21.63 percentage points under a unified protocol, while maintaining competitive performance on downstream RS tasks (RSVQA/RSVG).

In this paper, we propose CycFlow, a framework that replaces iterative edge denoising with deterministic point transport. CycFlow learns an instance-conditioned vector field that continuously transports input 2D coordinates to a canonical circular arrangement, where the optimal tour is recovered from this $2N$ dimensional representation via angular sorting. By leveraging data-dependent flow matching, we bypass the quadratic bottleneck of edge scoring in favor of linear coordinate dynamics.

    "summary": "We study the problem of predicting numeric labels that are constrained to the integers or to a subrange of the integers. For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.",

    "summary": "Speech Enhancement (SE) in audio devices is often supported by auxiliary modules for Voice Activity Detection (VAD), SNR estimation, or Acoustic Scene Classification to ensure robust context-aware behavior and seamless user experience. Just like SE, these tasks often employ deep learning; however, deploying additional models on-device is computationally impractical, whereas cloud-based inference would introduce additional latency and compromise privacy. Prior work on SE employed Dynamic Channel Pruning (DynCP) to reduce computation by adaptively disabling specific channels based on the current input. In this work, we investigate whether useful signal properties can be estimated from these internal pruning masks, thus removing the need for separate models. We show that simple, interpretable predictors achieve up to 93% accuracy on VAD, 84% on noise classification, and an R2 of 0.86 on F0 estimation. With binary masks, predictions reduce to weighted sums, inducing negligible overhead. Our contribution is twofold: on one hand, we examine the emergent behavior of DynCP models through the lens of downstream prediction tasks, to reveal what they are learning; on the other, we repurpose and re-propose DynCP as a holistic solution for efficient SE and simultaneous estimation of signal properties.",

Existing methods primarily rely on a direct text-to-HOI mapping, which suffers from three key limitations due to the significant cross-modality gap: (Q1) sub-optimal human motion, (Q2) unnatural object motion, and (Q3) weak interaction between humans and objects. To address these challenges, we propose MP-HOI, a novel framework grounded in four core insights: (1) Multimodal Data Priors: We leverage multimodal data (text, image, pose/object) from large multimodal models as priors to guide HOI generation, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in data modeling. (2) Enhanced Object Representation: We improve existing object representations by incorporating geometric keypoints, contact features, and dynamic properties, enabling expressive object representations, which tackles Q2 in data representation. (3) Multimodal-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Model: We propose a modality-aware MoE model for effective multimodal feature fusion paradigm, which tackles Q1 and Q2 in feature fusion. (4) Cascaded Diffusion with Interaction Supervision: We design a cascaded diffusion framework that progressively refines human-object interaction features under dedicated supervision, which tackles Q3 in interaction refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MP-HOI outperforms existing approaches in generating high-fidelity and fine-grained HOI motions.",

    "summary": "The prevailing paradigm in large language model (LLM) development is to pretrain a base model, then perform further training to improve performance and model behavior. However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.",

MerLin integrates optimized strong simulation of linear optical circuits into standard PyTorch and scikit learn workflows, enabling end to end differentiable training of quantum layers. MerLin is designed around systematic benchmarking and reproducibility. As an initial contribution, we reproduce eighteen state of the art photonic and hybrid QML works spanning kernel methods, reservoir computing, convolutional and recurrent architectures, generative models, and modern training paradigms. These reproductions are released as reusable, modular experiments that can be directly extended and adapted, establishing a shared experimental baseline consistent with empirical benchmarking methodologies widely adopted in modern artificial intelligence. By embedding photonic quantum models within established machine learning ecosystems, MerLin allows practitioners to leverage existing tooling for ablation studies, cross modality comparisons, and hybrid classical quantum workflows.

More recent efforts, including MIB and INTERPRETABILITY BENCHMARK-based on mechanistic interpretability, offer valuable perspectives on model failures; however, they remain insufficient for systematically characterizing cross-dimensional trade-offs. To address these gaps, we introduce MisAlign-Profile, a unified benchmark for measuring misalignment trade-offs inspired by mechanistic profiling. First, we construct MISALIGNTRADE, an English misaligned-aligned dataset across 112 normative domains taxonomies, including 14 safety, 56 value, and 42 cultural domains.

    "summary": "The development of effective initialization methods requires an understanding of random neural networks. In this work, a rigorous probabilistic analysis of deep unbiased Leaky ReLU networks is provided. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the logarithm of the norm of network activations, establishing that, as the number of layers increases, their growth is governed by a parameter called the Lyapunov exponent. This parameter characterizes a sharp phase transition between vanishing and exploding activations, and we calculate the Lyapunov exponent explicitly for Gaussian or orthogonal weight matrices. Our results reveal that standard methods, such as He initialization or orthogonal initialization, do not guarantee activation stabilty for deep networks of low width. Based on these theoretical insights, we propose a novel initialization method, referred to as Lyapunov initialization, which sets the Lyapunov exponent to zero and thereby ensures that the neural network is as stable as possible, leading empirically to improved learning.",

However, existing paradigms encounter a critical \"structural resolution mismatch,\" failing to reconcile divergent representational demands across varying graph densities, which precipitates structural noise interference in dense clusters and catastrophic representation collapse in sparse regions. We present SynergyKGC, an adaptive framework that advances traditional neighbor aggregation to an active Cross-Modal Synergy Expert via relation-aware cross-attention and semantic-intent-driven gating. By coupling a density-dependent Identity Anchoring strategy with a Double-tower Coherent Consistency architecture, SynergyKGC effectively reconciles topological heterogeneity while ensuring representational stability across training and inference phases. Systematic evaluations on two public benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in significantly boosting KGC hit rates, providing empirical evidence for a generalized principle of resilient information integration in non-homogeneous structured data.",

    "summary": "Native Language Identification (NLI) is a task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that typically determines the native language of an author through their writing or a speaker through their speaking. It has various applications in different areas, such as forensic linguistics and general linguistics studies. Although considerable research has been conducted on NLI regarding two different languages, such as English and German, the literature indicates a significant gap regarding NLI for dialects and subdialects. The gap becomes wider in less-resourced languages such as Kurdish. This research focuses on NLI within the context of a subdialect of Sorani (Central) Kurdish. It aims to investigate the NLI for Hewlêri, a subdialect spoken in Hewlêr (Erbil), the Capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. We collected about 24 hours of speech by recording interviews with 40 native or non-native Hewlêri speakers, 17 female and 23 male. We created three Neural Network-based models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which were evaluated through 66 experiments, covering various time-frames from 1 to 60 seconds, undersampling, oversampling, and cross-validation. The RNN model showed the highest accuracy of 95.92% for 5-second audio segmentation, using an 80:10:10 data splitting scheme. The created dataset is the first speech dataset for NLI on the Hewlêri subdialect in the Sorani Kurdish dialect, which can be of benefit to various research areas.",

Using techniques from Network Science and Machine Learning, including Erdős-Rényi for model sparsification, we enhance the efficiency of GNNs for real-world applications. We demonstrate our approach on N-1 contingency assessment in electrical grids, a critical task for ensuring grid reliability. We apply our methods to three datasets of varying sizes, exploring Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) with different degrees of sparsification and rewiring. Comparison across sparsification levels shows the potential of combining insights from both research fields to improve GNN performance and scalability. Our experiments highlight the importance of tuning sparsity parameters: while sparsity can improve generalization, excessive sparsity may hinder learning of complex patterns. Our adaptive rewiring approach, particularly when combined with early stopping, proves promising by allowing the model to adapt its connectivity structure during training. This research contributes to understanding how sparsity can be effectively leveraged in GNNs for critical applications like power grid reliability analysis.",

The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.",

Recent generative approaches, including diffusion models, show strong performance under hypervolume, yet their behavior under other established MOO metrics is less understood. We show that generative methods systematically underperform evolutionary alternatives with respect to other metrics, such as generational distance. We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO. We argue that overcoming this limitation requires out-of-distribution sampling in objective space (via an integral probability metric) and empirically observe that generative methods remain conservatively close to the offline objective distribution. Our results position offline MOO as a distribution-shift--limited problem and provide a diagnostic lens for understanding when and why generative optimization methods fail.",

    "summary": "Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs. The source code for this work can be found at https://github.com/Div290/FastFlow.",

    "summary": "Offline RL algorithms aim to improve upon the behavior policy that produces the collected data while constraining the learned policy to be within the support of the dataset. However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset. Results from experiments on the MuJoCo, Fetch, and AdroitHand environments show the correctness of the proposed LP form and the potential of the flexible $f$-divergence in improving performance for learning from a challenging dataset when applied to a compatible constrained optimization algorithm.",

Capturing this perceptual pathway is key to building natural full-duplex interactive systems. We introduce a framework that models this process as multi-level perception, and then reasons over conversational behaviors via a Graph-of-Thoughts (GoT). Our approach formalizes the intent-to-action pathway with a hierarchical labeling scheme, predicting high-level communicative intents and low-level speech acts to learn their causal and temporal dependencies. To train this system, we develop a high quality corpus that pairs controllable, event-rich dialogue data with human-annotated labels. The GoT framework structures streaming predictions as an evolving graph, enabling a transformer to forecast the next speech act, generate concise justifications for its decisions, and dynamically refine its reasoning. Experiments on both synthetic and real duplex dialogues show that the framework delivers robust behavior detection, produces interpretable reasoning chains, and establishes a foundation for benchmarking conversational reasoning in full duplex spoken dialogue systems.",

    "summary": "Formal privacy metrics provide compliance-oriented guarantees but often fail to quantify actual linkability in released datasets. We introduce CVPL (Cluster-Vector-Projection Linkage), a geometric framework for post-hoc assessment of linkage risk between original and protected tabular data. CVPL represents linkage analysis as an operator pipeline comprising blocking, vectorization, latent projection, and similarity evaluation, yielding continuous, scenario-dependent risk estimates rather than binary compliance verdicts. We formally define CVPL under an explicit threat model and introduce threshold-aware risk surfaces, R(lambda, tau), that capture the joint effects of protection strength and attacker strictness. We establish a progressive blocking strategy with monotonicity guarantees, enabling anytime risk estimation with valid lower bounds. We demonstrate that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage emerges as a special case of CVPL under restrictive assumptions, and that violations of these assumptions can lead to systematic over-linking bias. Empirical validation on 10,000 records across 19 protection configurations demonstrates that formal k-anonymity compliance may coexist with substantial empirical linkability, with a significant portion arising from non-quasi-identifier behavioral patterns. CVPL provides interpretable diagnostics identifying which features drive linkage feasibility, supporting privacy impact assessment, protection mechanism comparison, and utility-risk trade-off analysis.",

We present TVCACHE, a stateful tool-value cache for LLM agent post-training. TVCACHE maintains a tree of observed tool-call sequences and performs longest-prefix matching for cache lookups: a hit occurs only when the agent's full tool history matches a previously executed sequence, guaranteeing identical environment state.

TVCACHE achieves cache hit rates of up to 70% and reduces median tool call execution time by up to 6.9X, with no degradation in post-training reward accumulation.",

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence. This reveals that the burn-in phase of the RNN is an important tuning knob in its training, with significant impact on the performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting. In all experiments, we observe a strong influence of the burn-in phase on the training process, and proper tuning can lead to a reduction of the prediction error on the training and test data of more than 60% in some cases.",

    "summary": "The comprehensive understanding capabilities of world models for driving scenarios have significantly improved the planning accuracy of end-to-end autonomous driving frameworks. However, the redundant modeling of static regions and the lack of deep interaction with trajectories hinder world models from exerting their full effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Temporal Residual World Model (TR-World), which focuses on dynamic object modeling. By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features. This module can not only utilize future road conditions to refine trajectories, but also provides sparse spatial-temporal supervision on future BEV features to prevent world model collapse. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and NAVSIM datasets demonstrate that our method, namely ResWorld, achieves state-of-the-art planning performance.

    "summary": "We study the sample complexity of learning a uniform approximation of an $n$-dimensional cumulative distribution function (CDF) within an error $ε> 0$, when observations are restricted to a minimal one-bit feedback. This serves as a counterpart to the multivariate DKW inequality under ''full feedback'', extending it to the setting of ''bandit feedback''. Our main result shows a near-dimensional-invariance in the sample complexity: we get a uniform $ε$-approximation with a sample complexity $\\frac{1}{ε^3}{\\log\\left(\\frac 1 ε\\right)^{\\mathcal{O}(n)}}$ over a arbitrary fine grid, where the dimensionality $n$ only affects logarithmic terms. As direct corollaries, we provide tight sample complexity bounds and novel regret guarantees for learning fixed-price mechanisms in small markets, such as bilateral trade settings.",

    "summary": "Existing multimodal retrieval systems excel at semantic matching but implicitly assume that query-image relevance can be measured in isolation. This paradigm overlooks the rich dependencies inherent in realistic visual streams, where information is distributed across temporal sequences rather than confined to single snapshots. To bridge this gap, we introduce DeepImageSearch, a novel agentic paradigm that reformulates image retrieval as an autonomous exploration task. Models must plan and perform multi-step reasoning over raw visual histories to locate targets based on implicit contextual cues. We construct DISBench, a challenging benchmark built on interconnected visual data. To address the scalability challenge of creating context-dependent queries, we propose a human-model collaborative pipeline that employs vision-language models to mine latent spatiotemporal associations, effectively offloading intensive context discovery before human verification. Furthermore, we build a robust baseline using a modular agent framework equipped with fine-grained tools and a dual-memory system for long-horizon navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DISBench poses significant challenges to state-of-the-art models, highlighting the necessity of incorporating agentic reasoning into next-generation retrieval systems.",

    "summary": "In signal processing, the data collected from sensing devices is often a noisy linear superposition of multiple components, and the estimation of components of interest constitutes a crucial pre-processing step. In this work, we develop a Bayesian framework for signal component decomposition, which combines Gibbs sampling with plug-and-play (PnP) diffusion priors to draw component samples from the posterior distribution. Unlike many existing methods, our framework supports incorporating model-driven and data-driven prior knowledge into the diffusion prior in a unified manner. Moreover, the proposed posterior sampler allows component priors to be learned separately and flexibly combined without retraining. Under suitable assumptions, the proposed DiG sampler provably produces samples from the posterior distribution. We also show that DiG can be interpreted as an extension of a class of recently proposed diffusion-based samplers, and that, for suitable classes of sensing operators, DiG better exploits the structure of the measurement model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method over existing approaches.",

An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers.

Experiments show statistically significant gains in empathy metrics across three datasets. RE-LLM relatively improves the Emotional Reaction score by 14.79% and 6.76% compared to text-only and speech-LLM baselines on ESD. Notably, it raises the Exploration score by 35.42% and 3.91% on IEMOCAP, 139.28% and 9.83% on ESD, and 60.95% and 22.64% on MSP-PODCAST.

We focus on subject and object marking determined through various permutations of nominative, ergative, and dative noun forms. A treebank-based approach for the generation of minimal pairs using the Grew query language is implemented. We create a dataset of 370 syntactic tests made up of seven tasks containing 50-70 samples each, where three noun forms are tested in any given sample. Five encoder- and two decoder-only models are evaluated with word- and/or sentence-level accuracy metrics. Regardless of the specific syntactic makeup, models performed worst in assigning the ergative case correctly and strongest in assigning the nominative case correctly. Performance correlated with the overall frequency distribution of the three forms (NOM > DAT > ERG). Though data scarcity is a known issue for low-resource languages, we show that the highly specific role of the ergative along with a lack of available training data likely contributes to poor performance on this case. The dataset is made publicly available and the methodology provides an interesting avenue for future syntactic evaluations of languages where benchmarks are limited.",

    "summary": "Background: Subtle changes in spontaneous language production are among the earliest indicators of cognitive decline. Identifying linguistically interpretable markers of dementia can support transparent and clinically grounded screening approaches.   Methods: This study analyzes spontaneous speech transcripts from the DementiaBank Pitt Corpus using three linguistic representations: raw cleaned text, a part-of-speech (POS)-enhanced representation combining lexical and grammatical information, and a POS-only syntactic representation. Logistic regression and random forest models were evaluated under two protocols: transcript-level train-test splits and subject-level five-fold cross-validation to prevent speaker overlap. Model interpretability was examined using global feature importance, and statistical validation was conducted using Mann-Whitney U tests with Cliff's delta effect sizes.   Results: Across representations, models achieved stable performance, with syntactic and grammatical features retaining strong discriminative power even in the absence of lexical content. Subject-level evaluation yielded more conservative but consistent results, particularly for POS-enhanced and POS-only representations. Statistical analysis revealed significant group differences in functional word usage, lexical diversity, sentence structure, and discourse coherence, aligning closely with machine learning feature importance findings.   Conclusion: The results demonstrate that abstract linguistic features capture robust markers of early cognitive decline under clinically realistic evaluation. By combining interpretable machine learning with non-parametric statistical validation, this study supports the use of linguistically grounded features for transparent and reliable language-based cognitive screening.",

    "summary": "Human languages provide efficient systems for expressing numerosities, but whether the sheer pressure to communicate is enough for numerical representations to arise in artificial agents, and whether the emergent codes resemble human numerals at all, remains an open question. We study two neural network-based agents that must communicate numerosities in a referential game using either discrete tokens or continuous sketches, thus exploring both symbolic and iconic representations. Without any pre-defined numeric concepts, the agents achieve high in-distribution communication accuracy in both communication channels and converge on high-precision symbol-meaning mappings. However, the emergent code is non-compositional: the agents fail to derive systematic messages for unseen numerosities, typically reusing the symbol of the highest trained numerosity (discrete), or collapsing extrapolated values onto a single sketch (continuous). We conclude that the communication pressure alone suffices for precise transmission of learned numerosities, but additional pressures are needed to yield compositional codes and generalisation abilities.",

Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts.

In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.",

However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

To improve training dynamics when transitioning from causal to bidirectional attention, we propose Gradient-Guided Soft Masking, a gradient-based pre-warmup applied before a linear scheduler that gradually opens future attention during optimization. Evaluated on 9 industrial user cognition benchmarks covering prediction, preference, and marketing sensitivity tasks, our approach consistently yields more stable training and higher-quality bidirectional representations compared with causal, hybrid, and scheduler-only baselines, while remaining compatible with decoder pretraining.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has driven recent advances in LLM post-training, in particular for reasoning. Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.",

    "summary": "We study the training and performance of physics-informed learning for initial and boundary value problems (IBVP) with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from a statistical learning perspective. Specifically, we restrict ourselves to parameterizations with hard initial and boundary condition constraints and reformulate the problem of estimating PINN parameters as a statistical learning problem. From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $δ(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions. Furthermore, this analysis show that physics-informed learning with PINNs is a singular learning problem, and we employ singular learning theory tools, namely the so-called Local Learning Coefficient (Lau et al., 2025) to analyze the estimates of PINN parameters obtained via stochastic optimization for a heat equation IBVP. Finally, we discuss implications of this analysis on the quantification of predictive uncertainty of PINNs and the extrapolation capacity of PINNs.",

    "title": "Computational Phenomenology of Temporal Experience in Autism: Quantifying the Emotional and Narrative Characteristics of Lived Unpredictability",
    "summary": "Disturbances in temporality, such as desynchronization with the social environment and its unpredictability, are considered core features of autism with a deep impact on relationships. However, limitations regarding research on this issue include: 1) the dominance of deficit-based medical models of autism, 2) sample size in qualitative research, and 3) the lack of phenomenological anchoring in computational research. To bridge the gap between phenomenological and computational approaches and overcome sample-size limitations, our research integrated three methodologies. Study A: structured phenomenological interviews with autistic individuals using the Transdiagnostic Assessment of Temporal Experience. Study B: computational analysis of an autobiographical corpus of autistic narratives built for this purpose. Study C: a replication of a computational study using narrative flow measures to assess the perceived phenomenological authenticity of autistic autobiographies. Interviews revealed that the most significant differences between the autistic and control groups concerned unpredictability of experience. Computational results mirrored these findings: the temporal lexicon in autistic narratives was significantly more negatively valenced - particularly the \"Immediacy & Suddenness\" category. Outlier analysis identified terms associated with perceived discontinuity (unpredictably, precipitously, and abruptly) as highly negative. The computational analysis of narrative flow found that the autistic narratives contained within the corpus quantifiably resemble autobiographical stories more than imaginary ones. Overall, the temporal challenges experienced by autistic individuals were shown to primarily concern lived unpredictability and stem from the contents of lived experience, and not from autistic narrative construction.",

    "summary": "Research on misinformation has focused almost exclusively on supply, asking what falsehoods circulate, who produces them, and whether corrections work. A basic demand-side question remains unanswered. When ordinary people can fact-check anything they want, what do they actually ask about? We provide the first large-scale evidence on this question by analyzing close to 2{,}500 statements submitted by 457 participants to an open-ended AI fact-checking system. Each claim is classified along five semantic dimensions (domain, epistemic form, verifiability, target entity, and temporal reference), producing a behavioral map of public verification demand. Three findings stand out. First, users range widely across topics but default to a narrow epistemic repertoire, overwhelmingly submitting simple descriptive claims about present-day observables. Second, roughly one in four requests concerns statements that cannot be empirically resolved, including moral judgments, speculative predictions, and subjective evaluations, revealing a systematic mismatch between what users seek from fact-checking tools and what such tools can deliver. Third, comparison with the FEVER benchmark dataset exposes sharp structural divergences across all five dimensions, indicating that standard evaluation corpora encode a synthetic claim environment that does not resemble real-world verification needs. These results reframe fact-checking as a demand-driven problem and identify where current AI systems and benchmarks are misaligned with the uncertainty people actually experience.",

    "summary": "Participatory approaches are widely invoked in AI governance, yet participation rarely translates into durable influence. In public sector and civic AI systems, community contributions such as deliberations, annotations, prompts, and incident reports are often recorded informally, weakly linked to system updates, and disconnected from enforceable rights or sustained compensation. As a result, participation is frequently symbolic rather than accountable. We introduce the Participation Ledger, a machine readable and auditable framework that operationalizes participation as traceable influence, enforceable authority, and compensable labor. The ledger represents participation as an influence graph that links contributed artifacts to verified changes in AI systems, including datasets, prompts, adapters, policies, guardrails, and evaluation suites. It integrates three elements: a Participation Evidence Standard documenting consent, privacy, compensation, and reuse terms; an influence tracing mechanism that connects system updates to replayable before and after tests, enabling longitudinal monitoring of commitments; and encoded rights and incentives. Capability Vouchers allow authorized community stewards to request or constrain specific system capabilities within defined boundaries, while Participation Credits support ongoing recognition and compensation when contributed tests continue to provide value. We ground the framework in four urban AI and public space governance deployments and provide a machine readable schema, templates, and an evaluation plan for assessing traceability, enforceability, and compensation in practice.",

    "title": "Training-Induced Bias Toward LLM-Generated Content in Dense Retrieval",
    "summary": "Dense retrieval is a promising approach for acquiring relevant context or world knowledge in open-domain natural language processing tasks and is now widely used in information retrieval applications. However, recent reports claim a broad preference for text generated by large language models (LLMs). This bias is called \"source bias\", and it has been hypothesized that lower perplexity contributes to this effect. In this study, we revisit this claim by conducting a controlled evaluation to trace the emergence of such preferences across training stages and data sources. Using parallel human- and LLM-generated counterparts of the SciFact and Natural Questions (NQ320K) datasets, we compare unsupervised checkpoints with models fine-tuned using in-domain human text, in-domain LLM-generated text, and MS MARCO. Our results show the following: 1) Unsupervised retrievers do not exhibit a uniform pro-LLM preference. The direction and magnitude depend on the dataset. 2) Across the settings tested, supervised fine-tuning on MS MARCO consistently shifts the rankings toward LLM-generated text. 3) In-domain fine-tuning produces dataset-specific and inconsistent shifts in preference. 4) Fine-tuning on LLM-generated corpora induces a pronounced pro-LLM bias. Finally, a retriever-centric perplexity probe involving the reattachment of a language modeling head to the fine-tuned dense retriever encoder indicates agreement with relevance near chance, thereby weakening the explanatory power of perplexity. Our study demonstrates that source bias is a training-induced phenomenon rather than an inherent property of dense retrievers.",

Most existing methods rely on category-specific training, which limits their flexibility in few-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose DMP-3DAD, a training-free framework for cross-category 3D anomaly detection based on multi-view realistic depth map projection. Specifically, by converting point clouds into a fixed set of realistic depth images, our method leverages a frozen CLIP visual encoder to extract multi-view representations and performs anomaly detection via weighted feature similarity, which does not require any fine-tuning or category-dependent adaptation. Extensive experiments on the ShapeNetPart dataset demonstrate that DMP-3DAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under few-shot setting. The results show that the proposed approach provides a simple yet effective solution for practical cross-category 3D anomaly detection.",

    "summary": "Many staff and students in higher education have adopted generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools in their work and study. GenAI is expected to enhance cognitive systems by enabling personalized learning and streamlining educational services. However, stakeholders perceptions of GenAI in higher education remain divided, shaped by cultural, disciplinary, and institutional contexts. In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration. Disciplinary-specific requirements reinforce the importance of stakeholder engagement when integrating GenAI into higher education. The high-level requirements and the framework provide practical guidance for universities aiming to harness GenAI while addressing stakeholder concerns and ensuring regulatory compliance.",

To evaluate this setting, we introduce \\textbf{LoCoMo-Plus}, a benchmark for assessing cognitive memory under cue--trigger semantic disconnect, where models must retain and apply latent constraints across long conversational contexts. We further show that conventional string-matching metrics and explicit task-type prompting are misaligned with such scenarios, and propose a unified evaluation framework based on constraint consistency. Experiments across diverse backbone models, retrieval-based methods, and memory systems demonstrate that cognitive memory remains challenging and reveals failures not captured by existing benchmarks.

    "summary": "With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.",

The proposed architecture is realized through GuadalPlanner, which defines standardized interfaces between planning, sensing, and vehicle execution. It is an open and extensible research tool that supports discrete graph-based environments and interchangeable planning strategies, and is built upon widely adopted robotics technologies, including ROS2, MAVLink, and MQTT. Its design allows the same algorithmic logic to be deployed in fully simulated environments, software-in-the-loop configurations, and physical autonomous vehicles using an identical execution pipeline.

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems. The code can be found here https://github.com/KiaRational/AurigaNet.",

This is the case, in particular, when considering functional outcomes observed over a continuous domain (e.g., time, or space). Estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects, known as CATE, has emerged as a crucial tool for personalized decision-making, but existing meta-learning frameworks are largely limited to scalar outcomes, failing to provide satisfying results in scientific applications that leverage the rich, continuous information encoded in functional data. Here, we introduce FOCaL (Functional Outcome Causal Learning), a novel, doubly robust meta-learner specifically engineered to estimate a functional heterogeneous treatment effect (F-CATE). FOCaL integrates advanced functional regression techniques for both outcome modeling and functional pseudo-outcome reconstruction, thereby enabling the direct and robust estimation of F-CATE. We provide a rigorous theoretical derivation of FOCaL, demonstrate its performance and robustness compared to existing non-robust functional methods through comprehensive simulation studies, and illustrate its practical utility on diverse real-world functional datasets. FOCaL advances the capabilities of machine intelligence to infer nuanced, individualized causal effects from complex data, paving the way for more precise and trustworthy AI systems in personalized medicine, adaptive policy design, and fundamental scientific discovery.",

Existing approaches obtain uncertainty through ensemble replication, fixed stochastic noise such as dropout, or post hoc calibration. Cross-regularized uncertainty learns uncertainty parameters during training using gradients routed through a held-out regularization split. The predictor is optimized on the training split for fit, while low-dimensional uncertainty controls are optimized on the regularization split to reduce train-test mismatch, yielding regime-adaptive uncertainty without per-regime noise tuning. The framework can learn continuous noise levels at the output head, within hidden features, or within operator-specific components such as spectral modes. We instantiate the approach in Fourier Neural Operators and evaluate on APEBench sweeps over observed fraction and training-set size. Across these sweeps, the learned predictive distributions are better calibrated on held-out splits and the resulting uncertainty fields concentrate in high-error regions in one-step spatial diagnostics.",

Although the target is globally a high-degree polynomial, its compositional structure allows learning to proceed in stages: an intermediate representation reveals structure that is inaccessible at the input level. This reduces learning to simpler spectral estimation problems, well studied in the context of multi-index models, whereas any shallow estimator must resolve all components simultaneously. Our analysis relies on Gaussian universality, leading to sharp separations in sample complexity between two and three-layer learning strategies.",

    "summary": "Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have introduced zero-shot prediction capabilities that bypass the need for task-specific training. Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage). We provide practical model selection guidelines and release the complete benchmark framework for reproducibility.",

    "summary": "Estimating the expectation of a real-valued function of a random variable from sample data is a critical aspect of statistical analysis, with far-reaching implications in various applications. Current methodologies typically assume (semi-)parametric distributions such as Gaussian or mixed Gaussian, leading to significant estimation uncertainty if these assumptions do not hold. We propose a flow-based model, integrated with stratified sampling, that leverages a parametrized neural network to offer greater flexibility in modeling unknown data distributions, thereby mitigating this limitation. Our model shows a marked reduction in estimation uncertainty across multiple datasets, including high-dimensional (30 and 128) ones, outperforming crude Monte Carlo estimators and Gaussian mixture models.

    "summary": "Training stability remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs). Policy staleness, asynchronous training, and mismatches between training and inference engines all cause the behavior policy to diverge from the current policy, risking training collapse. Importance sampling provides a principled correction for this distribution shift but suffers from high variance; existing remedies such as token-level clipping and sequence-level normalization lack a unified theoretical foundation. We propose Variational sEquence-level Soft Policy Optimization (VESPO). By incorporating variance reduction into a variational formulation over proposal distributions, VESPO derives a closed-form reshaping kernel that operates directly on sequence-level importance weights without length normalization. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that VESPO maintains stable training under staleness ratios up to 64x and fully asynchronous execution, and delivers consistent gains across both dense and Mixture-of-Experts models.

    "summary": "This work addresses the problem of analyzing cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems which operate under partial observability and temporal role dependency, framed within a destructive multi-agent foraging setting. Unlike most previous studies, which focus primarily on algorithmic performance with respect to task completion, this article proposes a systematic set of general-purpose cooperation metrics aimed at characterizing not only efficiency, but also coordination and dependency between teams and agents, fairness, and sensitivity. These metrics are designed to be transferable to different multi-agent sequential domains similar to foraging. The proposed suite of metrics is structured into three main categories that jointly provide a multilevel characterization of cooperation: primary metrics, inter-team metrics, and intra-team metrics. They have been validated in a realistic destructive foraging scenario inspired by dynamic aquatic surface cleaning using heterogeneous autonomous vehicles. It involves two specialized teams with sequential dependencies: one focused on the search of resources, and another on their destruction. Several representative approaches have been evaluated, covering both learning-based algorithms and classical heuristic paradigms.",

    "summary": "Many real-world datasets contain hidden structure that cannot be detected by simple linear correlations between input features. For example, latent factors may influence the data in a coordinated way, even though their effect is invisible to covariance-based methods such as PCA. In practice, nonlinear neural networks often succeed in extracting such hidden structure in unsupervised and self-supervised learning. However, constructing a minimal high-dimensional model where this advantage can be rigorously analyzed has remained an open theoretical challenge. We introduce a tractable high-dimensional spiked model with two latent factors: one visible to covariance, and one statistically dependent yet uncorrelated, appearing only in higher-order moments. PCA and linear autoencoders fail to recover the latter, while a minimal nonlinear autoencoder provably extracts both. We analyze both the population risk, and empirical risk minimization. Our model also provides a tractable example where self-supervised test loss is poorly aligned with representation quality: nonlinear autoencoders recover latent structure that linear methods miss, even though their reconstruction loss is higher.",

We developed AMAP-APP, a cross-platform desktop application designed to overcome these barriers.   Methods: AMAP-APP optimizes efficiency by replacing intensive instance segmentation with classic image processing while retaining the original semantic segmentation model. It introduces a refined Region of Interest (ROI) algorithm to improve precision. Validation involved 365 mouse and human images (STED and confocal), benchmarking performance against the original AMAP via Pearson correlation and Two One-Sided T-tests (TOST).   Results: AMAP-APP achieved a 147-fold increase in processing speed on consumer hardware. Morphometric outputs (area, perimeter, circularity, and slit diaphragm density) showed high correlation (r>0.90) and statistical equivalence (TOST P<0.05) to the original method. Additionally, the new ROI algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared to the original, showing reduced deviation from manual delineations.   Conclusion: AMAP-APP democratizes deep learning-based podocyte morphometry. By eliminating the need for high-performance computing clusters and providing a user-friendly interface for Windows, macOS, and Linux, it enables widespread adoption in nephrology research and potential clinical diagnostics.",

    "summary": "Understanding what constitutes high-quality pre-training data remains a central question in language model training. In this work, we investigate whether benchmark performance is primarily driven by the degree of statistical pattern overlap between pre-training corpora and evaluation datasets. We measure this overlap using word-level unigram cross-entropy and word frequency statistics, and perform controlled experiments across $10$ zero-shot benchmarks, $4$ pre-training datasets spanning $8.5\\mathrm{B}$ to $60\\mathrm{B}$ tokens, and model sizes ranging from $400\\mathrm{M}$ to $3\\mathrm{B}$ parameters. Our results demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between word-level unigram cross-entropy and benchmark performance, suggesting that widely used benchmarks are strongly influenced by word overlap between training and evaluation data. Thus, larger pre-training subsets with similar word-level unigram cross-entropy yield improved downstream results, indicating that word frequency statistics play an additional role in shaping benchmark scores. Taken together, these results suggest that many standard benchmarks are only weakly out-of-distribution relative to pre-training corpora, so that simple word-overlap statistics predict benchmark performance.",

We introduce PhyCritic, a multimodal critic model optimized for physical AI through a two-stage RLVR pipeline: a physical skill warmup stage that enhances physically oriented perception and reasoning, followed by self-referential critic finetuning, where the critic generates its own prediction as an internal reference before judging candidate responses, improving judgment stability and physical correctness. Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.",

Here we introduce the Materials Knowledge Navigation Agent (MKNA), a language-driven system that translates natural-language scientific intent into executable actions for database retrieval, property prediction, structure generation, and stability evaluation. Beyond automating tool invocation, MKNA autonomously extracts quantitative thresholds and chemically meaningful design motifs from literature and database evidence, enabling data-grounded hypothesis formation. Applied to the search for high-Debye-temperature ceramics, the agent identifies a literature-supported screening criterion (Theta_D > 800 K), rediscovers canonical ultra-stiff materials such as diamond, SiC, SiN, and BeO, and proposes thermodynamically stable, previously unreported Be-C-rich compounds that populate the sparsely explored 1500-1700 K regime. These results demonstrate that MKNA not only finds stable candidates but also reconstructs interpretable design heuristics, establishing a generalizable platform for autonomous, language-guided materials exploration.",

While recent works have further proven the universality of a (slightly generalized) model, the next immediate question pertains to its trainability, i.e., whether it suffers from the exponentially vanishing loss gradients, known as the barren plateau issue, preventing effective use, and how regimes of trainability overlap with regimes of possible quantum advantage. Here, we provide significant strides in these directions. To study the trainability at initialization, we analytically derive closed-form expressions for the variances of the partial derivatives of the MMD loss function and provide general upper and lower bounds. With uniform initialization, we show that barren plateaus depend on the generator set and the spectrum of the chosen kernel. We identify regimes in which low-weight-biased kernels avoid exponential gradient suppression in structured topologies. Also, we prove that a small-variance Gaussian initialization ensures polynomial scaling for the gradient under mild conditions. As for the potential quantum advantage, we further argue, based on previous complexity-theoretic arguments, that sparse IQP families can output a probability distribution family that is classically intractable, and that this distribution remains trainable at initialization at least at lower-weight frequencies.",

    "summary": "Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on sensors and deep neural networks (DNNs) to perceive their surrounding environment and make maneuver decisions in real time. However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.",

    "summary": "Deep neural networks for chest X-ray classification achieve strong average performance, yet often underperform for specific demographic subgroups, raising critical concerns about clinical safety and equity. Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Traditional visible-light-based methods face limitations due to insufficient spectral information, particularly struggling with cloud interference and semi-transparent smoke regions. To address these challenges, we introduce hyperspectral imaging for smoke segmentation and present the first hyperspectral smoke segmentation dataset (HSSDataset) with carefully annotated samples collected from over 18,000 frames across 20 real-world scenarios using a Many-to-One annotations protocol. However, different spectral bands exhibit varying discriminative capabilities across spatial regions, necessitating adaptive band weighting strategies. We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting. We further construct a multispectral dataset (MSSDataset) with RGB-infrared images. Extensive experiments validate superior performance across both hyperspectral and multispectral modalities, establishing a new paradigm for spectral-based smoke segmentation.",

    "summary": "Geospatial foundation models (GFMs) are a fast-emerging paradigm for various geospatial tasks, such as ecological mapping. However, the utility of GFMs has not been fully explored for high-value use cases. This study aims to explore the utility, challenges and opportunities associated with the application of GFMs for ecological uses. In this regard, we fine-tune several pretrained AI models, namely, Prithvi-E0-2.0 and TerraMind, across three use cases, and compare this with a baseline ResNet-101 model. Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models. Nonetheless, consideration should be given to the divergence of input data from pretrained modalities. We note that these models would benefit from higher resolution and more accurate labels, especially for use cases where pixel-level dynamics need to be mapped.",

    "title": "(MGS)$^2$-Net: Unifying Micro-Geometric Scale and Macro-Geometric Structure for Cross-View Geo-Localization",
    "summary": "Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) is pivotal for GNSS-denied UAV navigation but remains brittle under the drastic geometric misalignment between oblique aerial views and orthographic satellite references. Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200. Furthermore, the framework exhibits superior cross-dataset generalization against geometric ambiguity.

    "summary": "Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) has emerged as a robust relaxation of standard Optimal Transport, particularly effective for handling outliers and mass variations. However, scalable algorithms for UOT, specifically those based on Gradient Descent (SGD), remain largely underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the semi-dual formulation of Entropic UOT and demonstrating its suitability for adaptive gradient methods. While the semi-dual is a standard tool for large-scale balanced OT, its geometry in the unbalanced setting appears ill-conditioned under standard analysis. Specifically, worst-case bounds on the marginal penalties using $χ^2$ divergence suggest a condition number scaling with $n/\\varepsilon$, implying poor scalability. In contrast, we show that the local condition number actually scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$, effectively removing the ill-conditioned dependence on $n$. Exploiting this property, we prove that SGD methods adapt to this local curvature, achieving a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\varepsilon T)$ in the stochastic and online regimes, making it suitable for large-scale and semi-discrete applications. Finally, for the full batch discrete setting, we derive a nearly tight upper bound on local smoothness depending solely on the gradient. Using it to adapt step sizes, we propose a modified Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (ANAG) method on the semi-dual functional and prove that it achieves a local complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\sqrt{1/\\varepsilon}\\ln(1/δ))$.",

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.",

While existing methods successfully control body pose, they lack specific control over hair, and as a result, fail to capture the intricate hair motions, resulting in stiff and unrealistic animations. HairWeaver overcomes this limitation using two specialized modules: a Motion-Context-LoRA to integrate motion conditions and a Sim2Real-Domain-LoRA to preserve the subject's photoreal appearance across different data domains. These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, producing lifelike human hair animations with dynamic details.",

    "summary": "We propose a constructive algorithm for identifying complete data distributions in graphical models of missing data. The complete data distribution is unrestricted, while the missingness mechanism is assumed to factorize according to a conditional directed acyclic graph. Our approach follows an interventionist perspective in which missingness indicators are treated as variables that can be intervened on. A central challenge in this setting is that sequences of interventions on missingness indicators may induce and propagate selection bias, so that identification can fail even when a propensity score is invariant to available interventions. To address this challenge, we introduce a tree-based identification algorithm that explicitly tracks the creation and propagation of selection bias and determines whether it can be avoided through admissible intervention strategies. The resulting tree provides both a diagnostic and a constructive characterization of identifiability under a given missingness mechanism. Building on these results, we develop recursive inverse probability weighting procedures that mirror the intervention logic of the identification algorithm, yielding valid estimating equations for both the missingness mechanism and functionals of the complete data distribution. Simulation studies and a real-data application illustrate the practical performance of the proposed methods. An accompanying R package, flexMissing, implements all proposed procedures.",

To train semantic segmentation models, labeled point cloud segmentation datasets are essential. Meanwhile, point cloud labeling is time-consuming for annotators, which typically involves tuning the camera viewpoint and selecting points by lasso. To reduce the time cost of point cloud labeling, we propose a viewpoint recommendation approach to reduce annotators' labeling time costs. We adapt Fitts' law to model the time cost of lasso selection in point clouds. Using the modeled time cost, the viewpoint that minimizes the lasso selection time cost is recommended to the annotator. We build a data labeling system for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds that integrates our viewpoint recommendation approach. The system enables users to navigate to recommended viewpoints for efficient annotation. Through an ablation study, we observed that our approach effectively reduced the data labeling time cost. We also qualitatively compare our approach with previous viewpoint selection approaches on different datasets.",

    "summary": "Preconditioning is a common method applied to modify Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with the goal of making them more efficient. In practice it is often extremely effective, even when the preconditioner is learned from the chain. We analyse and compare the finite-time computational costs of schemes which learn a preconditioner based on the target covariance or the expected Hessian of the target potential with that of a corresponding scheme that does not use preconditioning. We apply our results to the Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA) for an appropriately regular target, establishing non-asymptotic guarantees for preconditioned ULA which learns its preconditioner. Our results are also applied to the unadjusted underdamped Langevin algorithm in the supplementary material. To do so, we establish non-asymptotic guarantees on the time taken to collect $N$ approximately independent samples from the target for schemes that learn their preconditioners under the assumption that the underlying Markov chain satisfies a contraction condition in the Wasserstein-2 distance. This approximate independence condition, that we formalize, allows us to bridge the non-asymptotic bounds of modern MCMC theory and classical heuristics of effective sample size and mixing time, and is needed to amortise the costs of learning a preconditioner across the many samples it will be used to produce.",

We revisit this question with 3--RQ analysis in RecogDrive by instantiating the system with a full VLM and vision-only backbones, all under an identical diffusion Transformer planner. RQ1: At the backbone level, the VLM can introduce additional subspaces upon the vision-only backbones. RQ2: This unique subspace leads to a different behavioral in some long-tail scenario: the VLM tends to be more aggressive whereas ViT is more conservative, and each decisively wins on about 2--3% of test scenarios; With an oracle that selects, per scenario, the better trajectory between the VLM and ViT branches, we obtain an upper bound of 93.58 PDMS. RQ3: To fully harness this observation, we propose HybridDriveVLA, which runs both ViT and VLM branches and selects between their endpoint trajectories using a learned scorer, improving PDMS to 92.10. Finally, DualDriveVLA implements a practical fast--slow policy: it runs ViT by default and invokes the VLM only when the scorer's confidence falls below a threshold; calling the VLM on 15% of scenarios achieves 91.00 PDMS while improving throughput by 3.2x.

    "summary": "Diffusion models have attained remarkable breakthroughs in the real-world super-resolution (SR) task, albeit at slow inference and high demand on devices. To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR. Against all odds, GenDR-Pix can restore 4K image in only 1 second and 6GB.",

To address this gap, we introduce CyclingVQA, a diagnostic benchmark designed to probe perception, spatio-temporal understanding, and traffic-rule-to-lane reasoning from a cyclist's perspective. Evaluating 31+ recent VLMs spanning general-purpose, spatially enhanced, and autonomous-driving-specialized models, we find that current models demonstrate encouraging capabilities, while also revealing clear areas for improvement in cyclist-centric perception and reasoning, particularly in interpreting cyclist-specific traffic cues and associating signs with the correct navigational lanes. Notably, several driving-specialized models underperform strong generalist VLMs, indicating limited transfer from vehicle-centric training to cyclist-assistive scenarios. Finally, through systematic error analysis, we identify recurring failure modes to guide the development of more effective cyclist-assistive intelligent systems.",

The summary network yielded a more focused posterior and generated posterior predictive traces that accurately captured the membrane potential dynamics. When using handcrafted summary statistics, posterior predictive traces match the included features but show deviations in the exact dynamics. The posteriors showed signs of bias and miscalibration but were still able to yield posterior predictive samples that were close to the target observations on which the posteriors were constrained.
