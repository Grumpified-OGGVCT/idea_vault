    "title": "Model soups need only one ingredient",
    "summary": "Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on a target distribution often improves in-distribution (ID) accuracy, but at the cost of out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness as representations specialize to the fine-tuning data. Weight-space ensembling methods, such as Model Soups, mitigate this effect by averaging multiple checkpoints, but they are computationally prohibitive, requiring the training and storage of dozens of fine-tuned models. In this paper, we introduce MonoSoup, a simple, data-free, hyperparameter-free, post-hoc method that achieves a strong ID-OOD balance using only a single checkpoint. Our method applies Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to each layer's update and decomposes it into high-energy directions that capture task-specific adaptation and low-energy directions that introduce noise but may still encode residual signals useful for robustness. MonoSoup then uses entropy-based effective rank to automatically re-weigh these components with layer-wise coefficients that account for the spectral and geometric structure of the model. Experiments on CLIP models fine-tuned on ImageNet and evaluated under natural distribution shifts, as well as on Qwen language models tested on mathematical reasoning and multiple-choice benchmarks, show that this plug-and-play approach is a practical and effective alternative to multi-checkpoint methods, retaining much of their benefits without their computational overhead.",

    "summary": "Modern image generators produce strikingly realistic images, where only artifacts like distorted hands or warped objects reveal their synthetic origin. Detecting these artifacts is essential: without detection, we cannot benchmark generators or train reward models to improve them. Current detectors fine-tune VLMs on tens of thousands of labeled images, but this is expensive to repeat whenever generators evolve or new artifact types emerge. We show that pretrained VLMs already encode the knowledge needed to detect artifacts - with the right scaffolding, this capability can be unlocked using only a few hundred labeled examples per artifact category. Our system, ArtifactLens, achieves state-of-the-art on five human artifact benchmarks (the first evaluation across multiple datasets) while requiring orders of magnitude less labeled data. The scaffolding consists of a multi-component architecture with in-context learning and text instruction optimization, with novel improvements to each. Our methods generalize to other artifact types - object morphology, animal anatomy, and entity interactions - and to the distinct task of AIGC detection.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications such as travel assistance and purchasing support, they are often required to make subjective choices on behalf of users in settings where no objectively correct answer exists. We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks. Overall, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of using LLMs for subjective decision support and underscore the importance of careful model selection, prompt design, and user representation when deploying such systems in practice.",

    "summary": "Despite algorithm-level innovations for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), the underlying networked infrastructure for large-scale MARL training remains underexplored. Existing training frameworks primarily optimize for single-agent scenarios and fail to address the unique system-level challenges of MARL, including rollout-training synchronization barriers, rollout load imbalance, and training resource underutilization. To bridge this gap, we propose FlexMARL, the first end-to-end training framework that holistically optimizes rollout, training, and their orchestration for large-scale LLM-based MARL. Specifically, FlexMARL introduces the joint orchestrator to manage data flow under the rollout-training disaggregated architecture. Building upon the experience store, a novel micro-batch driven asynchronous pipeline eliminates the synchronization barriers while providing strong consistency guarantees. Rollout engine adopts a parallel sampling scheme combined with hierarchical load balancing, which adapts to skewed inter/intra-agent request patterns. Training engine achieves on-demand hardware binding through agent-centric resource allocation. The training states of different agents are swapped via unified and location-agnostic communication. Empirical results on a large-scale production cluster demonstrate that FlexMARL achieves up to 7.3x speedup and improves hardware utilization by up to 5.6x compared to existing frameworks.",

    "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been shown to significantly improve the reasoning accuracy of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.",

    "title": "AGMark: Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking for Large Vision-Language Models",
    "summary": "Watermarking has emerged as a pivotal solution for content traceability and intellectual property protection in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, vision-agnostic watermarks may introduce visually irrelevant tokens and disrupt visual grounding by enforcing indiscriminate pseudo-random biases. Additionally, current vision-specific watermarks rely on a static, one-time estimation of vision critical weights and ignore the weight distribution density when determining the proportion of protected tokens. This design fails to account for dynamic changes in visual dependence during generation and may introduce low-quality tokens in the long tail. To address these challenges, we propose Attention-Guided Dynamic Watermarking (AGMark), a novel framework that embeds detectable signals while strictly preserving visual fidelity. At each decoding step, AGMark first dynamically identifies semantic-critical evidence based on attention weights for visual relevance, together with context-aware coherence cues, resulting in a more adaptive and well-calibrated evidence-weight distribution. It then determines the proportion of semantic-critical tokens by jointly considering uncertainty awareness (token entropy) and evidence calibration (weight density), thereby enabling adaptive vocabulary partitioning to avoid irrelevant tokens. Empirical results confirm that AGMark outperforms conventional methods, observably improving generation quality and yielding particularly strong gains in visual semantic fidelity in the later stages of generation. The framework maintains highly competitive detection accuracy (at least 99.36\\% AUC) and robust attack resilience (at least 88.61\\% AUC) without sacrificing inference efficiency, effectively establishing a new standard for reliability-preserving multi-modal watermarking.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed to automatically label and analyze educational dialogue at scale, yet current pipelines lack reliable ways to detect when models are wrong. We investigate whether reasoning generated by LLMs can be used to predict the correctness of a model's own predictions. We analyze 30,300 teacher utterances from classroom dialogue, each labeled by multiple state-of-the-art LLMs with an instructional move construct and an accompanying reasoning. Using human-verified ground-truth labels, we frame the task as predicting whether a model's assigned label for a given utterance is correct. We encode LLM reasoning using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and evaluate five supervised classifiers. A Random Forest classifier achieves an F1 score of 0.83 (Recall = 0.854), successfully identifying most incorrect predictions and outperforming baselines. Training specialist detectors for specific instructional move constructs further improves performance on difficult constructs, indicating that error detection benefits from construct-specific linguistic cues. Using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework, we examine four linguistic markers of correctness: Causation, Differentiation, Tentativeness, and Insight. Correct predictions exhibit grounded causal language (e.g., because, therefore), while incorrect reasoning is substantially more likely to rely on epistemic hedging (e.g., might, could) and performative metacognition (e.g., think, realize). Syntactic complexity does not distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning, and longer reasoning is not more reliable. These findings demonstrate that reasoning-based error detection offers a practical and scalable approach to quality control in automated educational dialogue analysis.",

MATA maintains strong performance with small, open-source models and adapts easily across various LLM types. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks of varying difficulty with ten different LLMs demonstrate that MATA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and highly efficient reasoning while avoiding excessive LLM inference.

    "summary": "Fine-grained truck classification is critical for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), yet current LiDAR-based methods face scalability challenges due to their reliance on supervised deep learning and labor-intensive manual annotation. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer promising few-shot generalization, but their application to roadside LiDAR is limited by a modality gap between sparse 3D point clouds and dense 2D imagery. We propose a framework that bridges this gap by adapting off-the-shelf VLMs for fine-grained truck classification without parameter fine-tuning. Our new depth-aware image generation pipeline applies noise removal, spatial and temporal registration, orientation rectification, morphological operations, and anisotropic smoothing to transform sparse, occluded LiDAR scans into depth-encoded 2D visual proxies. Validated on a real-world dataset of 20 vehicle classes, our approach achieves competitive classification accuracy with as few as 16-30 examples per class, offering a scalable alternative to data-intensive supervised baselines. We further observe a \"Semantic Anchor\" effect: text-based guidance regularizes performance in ultra-low-shot regimes $k < 4$, but degrades accuracy in more-shot settings due to semantic mismatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this framework as a Cold Start strategy, using VLM-generated labels to bootstrap lightweight supervised models. Notably, the few-shot VLM-based model achieves over correct classification rate of 75 percent for specific drayage categories (20ft, 40ft, and 53ft containers) entirely without the costly training or fine-tuning, significantly reducing the intensive demands of initial manual labeling, thus achieving a method of practical use in ITS applications.",

    "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning has been able to solve various tasks successfully, however, due to the construction of policy gradient and training dynamics, tuning deep reinforcement learning models remains challenging. As one of the most successful deep reinforcement-learning algorithm, the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm (PPO) clips the policy gradient within a conservative on-policy updates, which ensures reliable and stable policy improvement. However, this training pattern may sacrifice sample efficiency. On the other hand, off-policy methods make more adequate use of data through sample reuse, though at the cost of increased the estimation variance and bias. To leverage the advantages of both, in this paper, we propose a new PPO variant based on the stability guarantee from conservative on-policy iteration with a more efficient off-policy data utilization. Specifically, we first derive an extended off-policy improvement from an expectation form of generalized policy improvement lower bound. Then, we extend the clipping mechanism with segmented exponential functions for a suitable surrogate objective function. Third, the trajectories generated by the past $M$ policies are organized in the replay buffer for off-policy training. We refer to this method as Extended Off-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (ExO-PPO). Compared with PPO and some other state-of-the-art variants, we demonstrate an improved performance of ExO-PPO with balanced sample efficiency and stability on varied tasks in the empirical experiments.",

First, we introduce HealthRubrics, a dataset of 7,034 physician-verified preference examples in which clinicians refine LLM-drafted rubrics to meet rigorous medical standards. Second, we distill these rubrics into HealthPrinciples: 119 broadly reusable, clinically grounded principles organized by clinical dimensions, enabling scalable supervision beyond manual annotation.

    "summary": "Data streams are rarely static in dynamic environments like Industry 4.0. Instead, they constantly change, making traditional offline models outdated unless they can quickly adjust to the new data. This need can be adequately addressed by continual learning (CL), which allows systems to gradually acquire knowledge without incurring the prohibitive costs of retraining them from scratch. Most research on continual learning focuses on classification problems, while very few studies address regression tasks. We propose the first prototype-based generative replay framework designed for online task-free continual regression. Our approach defines an adaptive output-space discretization model, enabling prototype-based generative replay for continual regression without storing raw data. Evidence obtained from several benchmark datasets shows that our framework reduces forgetting and provides more stable performance than other state-of-the-art solutions.",

    "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.",

    "summary": "Sustaining long-term interactions remains a bottleneck for Large Language Models (LLMs), as their limited context windows struggle to manage dialogue histories that extend over time. Existing memory systems often treat interactions as disjointed snippets, failing to capture the underlying narrative coherence of the dialogue stream. We propose TraceMem, a cognitively-inspired framework that weaves structured, narrative memory schemata from user conversational traces through a three-stage pipeline: (1) Short-term Memory Processing, which employs a deductive topic segmentation approach to demarcate episode boundaries and extract semantic representation; (2) Synaptic Memory Consolidation, a process that summarizes episodes into episodic memories before distilling them alongside semantics into user-specific traces; and (3) Systems Memory Consolidation, which utilizes two-stage hierarchical clustering to organize these traces into coherent, time-evolving narrative threads under unifying themes. These threads are encapsulated into structured user memory cards, forming narrative memory schemata. For memory utilization, we provide an agentic search mechanism to enhance reasoning process. Evaluation on the LoCoMo benchmark shows that TraceMem achieves state-of-the-art performance with a brain-inspired architecture. Analysis shows that by constructing coherent narratives, it surpasses baselines in multi-hop and temporal reasoning, underscoring its essential role in deep narrative comprehension. Additionally, we provide an open discussion on memory systems, offering our perspectives and future outlook on the field.

    "summary": "In today's connected world, the generation of massive streaming data across diverse domains has become commonplace. In the presence of concept drift, class imbalance, label scarcity, and new class emergence, they jointly degrade representation stability, bias learning toward outdated distributions, and reduce the resilience and reliability of detection in dynamic environments. This paper proposes SCIL (Streaming Class-Incremental Learning) to address these challenges. The SCIL framework integrates an autoencoder (AE) with a multi-layer perceptron for multi-class prediction, uses a dual-loss strategy (classification and reconstruction) for prediction and new class detection, employs corrected pseudo-labels for online training, manages classes with queues, and applies oversampling to handle imbalance. The rationale behind the method's structure is elucidated through ablation studies and a comprehensive experimental evaluation is performed using both real-world and synthetic datasets that feature class imbalance, incremental classes, and concept drifts. Our results demonstrate that SCIL outperforms strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods. Based on our commitment to Open Science, we make our code and datasets available to the community.",

    "summary": "Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) seeks the minima with a flat loss landscape to improve the generalization performance in machine learning tasks, including fine-tuning. However, its extra parameter perturbation step doubles the computation cost, which becomes the bottleneck of SAM in the practical implementation. In this work, we propose an approach SL-SAM to break this bottleneck by introducing the sparse technique to layers. Our key innovation is to frame the dynamic selection of layers for both the gradient ascent (perturbation) and descent (update) steps as a multi-armed bandit problem. At the beginning of each iteration, SL-SAM samples a part of the layers of the model according to the gradient norm to participate in the backpropagation of the following parameter perturbation and update steps, thereby reducing the computation complexity. We then provide the analysis to guarantee the convergence of SL-SAM. In the experiments of fine-tuning models in several tasks, SL-SAM achieves the performances comparable to the state-of-the-art baselines, including a \\#1 rank on LLM fine-tuning. Meanwhile, SL-SAM significantly reduces the ratio of active parameters in backpropagation compared to vanilla SAM (SL-SAM activates 47\\%, 22\\% and 21\\% parameters on the vision, moderate and large language model respectively while vanilla SAM always activates 100\\%), verifying the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.",

Through large-scale curated pretraining and targeted post-training, Covo-Audio achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance among models of comparable scale across a broad spectrum of tasks, including speech-text modeling, spoken dialogue, speech understanding, audio understanding, and full-duplex voice interaction. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the pretrained foundation model exhibits strong speech-text comprehension and semantic reasoning capabilities on multiple benchmarks, outperforming representative open-source models of comparable scale. Furthermore, Covo-Audio-Chat, the dialogue-oriented variant, demonstrates strong spoken conversational abilities, including understanding, contextual reasoning, instruction following, and generating contextually appropriate and empathetic responses, validating its applicability to real-world conversational assistant scenarios. Covo-Audio-Chat-FD, the evolved full-duplex model, achieves substantially superior performance on both spoken dialogue capabilities and full-duplex interaction behaviors, demonstrating its competence in practical robustness. To mitigate the high cost of deploying end-to-end LALMs for natural conversational systems, we propose an intelligence-speaker decoupling strategy that separates dialogue intelligence from voice rendering, enabling flexible voice customization with minimal text-to-speech (TTS) data while preserving dialogue performance. Overall, our results highlight the strong potential of 7B-scale models to integrate sophisticated audio intelligence with high-level semantic reasoning, and suggest a scalable path toward more capable and versatile LALMs.",

    "summary": "Text summarization is a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), and the information explosion has made long-document processing increasingly demanding, making summarization essential. Existing research mainly focuses on model improvements and sentence-level pruning, but often overlooks global structure, leading to disrupted coherence and weakened downstream performance. Some studies employ large language models (LLMs), which achieve higher accuracy but incur substantial resource and time costs. To address these issues, we introduce GloSA-sum, the first summarization approach that achieves global structure awareness via topological data analysis (TDA). GloSA-sum summarizes text efficiently while preserving semantic cores and logical dependencies. Specifically, we construct a semantic-weighted graph from sentence embeddings, where persistent homology identifies core semantics and logical structures, preserved in a ``protection pool'' as the backbone for summarization. We design a topology-guided iterative strategy, where lightweight proxy metrics approximate sentence importance to avoid repeated high-cost computations, thus preserving structural integrity while improving efficiency. To further enhance long-text processing, we propose a hierarchical strategy that integrates segment-level and global summarization. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that GloSA-sum reduces redundancy while preserving semantic and logical integrity, striking a balance between accuracy and efficiency, and further benefits LLM downstream tasks by shortening contexts while retaining essential reasoning chains.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal capabilities, yet their substantial size poses significant deployment challenges. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising solution for compressing these models, but existing methods primarily rely on static next-token alignment, neglecting the dynamic token interactions, which embed essential capabilities for multimodal understanding and generation. To this end, we introduce Align-TI, a novel KD framework designed from the perspective of Token Interactions. Our approach is motivated by the insight that MLLMs rely on two primary interactions: vision-instruction token interactions to extract relevant visual information, and intra-response token interactions for coherent generation. Accordingly, Align-TI introduces two components: IVA enables the student model to imitate the teacher's instruction-relevant visual information extract capability by aligning on salient visual regions. TPA captures the teacher's dynamic generative logic by aligning the sequential token-to-token transition probabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate Align-TI's superiority. Notably, our approach achieves $2.6\\%$ relative improvement over Vanilla KD, and our distilled Align-TI-2B even outperforms LLaVA-1.5-7B (a much larger MLLM) by $7.0\\%$, establishing a new state-of-the-art distillation framework for training parameter-efficient MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/lchen1019/Align-TI.",

    "summary": "The transition from symbolic manipulation to science-grade reasoning represents a pivotal frontier for Large Language Models (LLMs), with physics serving as the critical test anchor for binding abstract logic to physical reality. Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks.

    "summary": "Feature Engineering (FE) is pivotal in automated machine learning (AutoML) but remains a bottleneck for traditional methods, which treat it as a black-box search, operating within rigid, predefined search spaces and lacking domain awareness. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging semantic reasoning to generate unbounded operators, existing methods fail to construct free-form FE pipelines, remaining confined to isolated subtasks such as feature generation. Most importantly, they are rarely optimized jointly with hyperparameter optimization (HPO) of the ML model, leading to greedy \"FE-then-HPO\" workflows that cannot capture strong FE-HPO interactions. In this paper, we present CoFEH, a collaborative framework that interleaves LLM-based FE and Bayesian HPO for robust end-to-end AutoML. CoFEH uses an LLM-driven FE optimizer powered by Tree of Thought (ToT) to explore flexible FE pipelines, a Bayesian optimization (BO) module to solve HPO, and a dynamic optimizer selector that realizes interleaved optimization by adaptively scheduling FE and HPO steps. Crucially, we introduce a mutual conditioning mechanism that shares context between LLM and BO, enabling mutually informed decisions. Experiments show that CoFEH not only outperforms traditional and LLM-based FE baselines, but also achieves superior end-to-end performance under joint optimization.",

    "summary": "Recent studies show that text-to-image models often fail to generate geographically representative images, raising concerns about the representativeness of their training data and motivating the question: which parts of the world do these training examples come from? We geographically profile large-scale multimodal datasets by mapping image-caption pairs to countries based on location information extracted from captions using LLMs. Studying English captions from three widely used datasets (Re-LAION, DataComp1B, and Conceptual Captions) across $20$ common entities (e.g., house, flag), we find that the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada account for $48.0\\%$ of samples, while South American and African countries are severely under-represented with only $1.8\\%$ and $3.8\\%$ of images, respectively. We observe a strong correlation between a country's GDP and its representation in the data ($ρ= 0.82$). Examining non-English subsets for $4$ languages from the Re-LAION dataset, we find that representation skews heavily toward countries where these languages are predominantly spoken. Additionally, we find that higher representation does not necessarily translate to greater visual or semantic diversity. Finally, analyzing country-specific images generated by Stable Diffusion v1.3 trained on Re-LAION, we show that while generations appear realistic, they are severely limited in their coverage compared to real-world images.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of hateful content in online videos poses severe threats to individual well-being and societal harmony. However, existing solutions for video hate detection either rely heavily on large-scale human annotations or lack fine-grained temporal precision. In this work, we propose LELA, the first training-free Large Language Model (LLM) based framework for hate video localization. Distinct from state-of-the-art models that depend on supervised pipelines, LELA leverages LLMs and modality-specific captioning to detect and temporally localize hateful content in a training-free manner. Our method decomposes a video into five modalities, including image, speech, OCR, music, and video context, and uses a multi-stage prompting scheme to compute fine-grained hateful scores for each frame. We further introduce a composition matching mechanism to enhance cross-modal reasoning. Experiments on two challenging benchmarks, HateMM and MultiHateClip, demonstrate that LELA outperforms all existing training-free baselines by a large margin. We also provide extensive ablations and qualitative visualizations, establishing LELA as a strong foundation for scalable and interpretable hate video localization.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities in geo-localization, yet they often struggle in real-world scenarios where visual cues are sparse, long-tailed, and highly ambiguous. Previous approaches, bound by internal knowledge, often fail to provide verifiable results, yielding confident but ungrounded predictions when faced with confounded evidence. To address these challenges, we propose SpotAgent, a framework that formalizes geo-localization into an agentic reasoning process that leverages expert-level reasoning to synergize visual interpretation with tool-assisted verification. SpotAgent actively explores and verifies visual cues by leveraging external tools (e.g., web search, maps) through a ReAct diagram. We introduce a 3-stage post-training pipeline starting with a Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage for basic alignment, followed by an Agentic Cold Start phase utilizing high-quality trajectories synthesized via a Multi-Agent framework, aiming to instill tool-calling expertise. Subsequently, the model's reasoning capabilities are refined through Reinforcement Learning. We propose a Spatially-Aware Dynamic Filtering strategy to enhance the efficiency of the RL stage by prioritizing learnable samples based on spatial difficulty. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpotAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively mitigating hallucinations while delivering precise and verifiable geo-localization.",

Popular UED methods focus on Open-Endedness, where teacher algorithms rely on stochastic processes for infinite generation of useful environments. This assumption becomes impractical in resource-constrained scenarios where teacher-student interaction opportunities are limited. To address this challenge, we introduce a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework for environment design. Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.",

    "title": "Symbolic Pattern Temporal Numeric Planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects",
    "summary": "Recently, a Symbolic Pattern Planning (SPP) approach was proposed for numeric planning where a pattern (i.e., a finite sequence of actions) suggests a causal order between actions. The pattern is then encoded in a SMT formula whose models correspond to valid plans. If the suggestion by the pattern is inaccurate and no valid plan can be found, the pattern is extended until it contains the causal order of actions in a valid plan, making the approach complete. In this paper, we extend the SPP approach to the temporal planning with Intermediate Conditions and Effects (ICEs) fragment, where $(i)$ actions are durative (and thus can overlap over time) and have conditions/effects which can be checked/applied at any time during an action's execution, and $(ii)$ one can specify plan's conditions/effects that must be checked/applied at specific times during the plan execution. Experimental results show that our SPP planner Patty $(i)$ outperforms all other planners in the literature in the majority of temporal domains without ICEs, $(ii)$ obtains comparable results with the SoTA search planner for ICS in literature domains with ICEs, and $(iii)$ outperforms the same planner in a novel domain based on a real-world application.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a critical method for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, continuous training often leads to policy entropy collapse, characterized by a rapid decay in entropy that results in premature overconfidence, reduced output diversity, and vanishing gradient norms that inhibit learning. Gradient-Preserving Clipping is a primary factor influencing these dynamics, but existing mitigation strategies are largely static and lack a framework connecting clipping mechanisms to precise entropy control. This paper proposes reshaping entropy control in RL from the perspective of Gradient-Preserving Clipping. We first theoretically and empirically verify the contributions of specific importance sampling ratio regions to entropy growth and reduction. Leveraging these findings, we introduce a novel regulation mechanism using dynamic clipping threshold to precisely manage entropy. Furthermore, we design and evaluate dynamic entropy control strategies, including increase-then-decrease, decrease-increase-decrease, and oscillatory decay. Experimental results demonstrate that these strategies effectively mitigate entropy collapse, and achieve superior performance across multiple benchmarks.",

We establish a direct connection between Lyapunov exponents and adversarial vulnerability, and propose a novel training algorithm that improves robustness by FTLE regularization.

    "summary": "Real-world fine-tuning of dexterous manipulation policies remains challenging due to limited real-world interaction budgets and highly multimodal action distributions. Diffusion-based policies, while expressive, do not permit conservative likelihood-based updates during fine-tuning because action probabilities are intractable. In contrast, conventional Gaussian policies collapse under multimodality, particularly when actions are executed in chunks, and standard per-step critics fail to align with chunked execution, leading to poor credit assignment. We present SOFT-FLOW, a sample-efficient off-policy fine-tuning framework with normalizing flow (NF) to address these challenges. The normalizing flow policy yields exact likelihoods for multimodal action chunks, allowing conservative, stable policy updates through likelihood regularization and thereby improving sample efficiency. An action-chunked critic evaluates entire action sequences, aligning value estimation with the policy's temporal structure and improving long-horizon credit assignment. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a likelihood-based, multimodal generative policy combined with chunk-level value learning on real robotic hardware. We evaluate SOFT-FLOW on two challenging dexterous manipulation tasks in the real world: cutting tape with scissors retrieved from a case, and in-hand cube rotation with a palm-down grasp -- both of which require precise, dexterous control over long horizons. On these tasks, SOFT-FLOW achieves stable, sample-efficient adaptation where standard methods struggle.",

Specifically, we focus on replicable PAC learning and its connections to differential privacy (Dwork et al. [TCC 2006]) and to the statistical query (SQ) model (Kearns [JACM `98]). Statistically, it was known that differentially private learning and replicable learning are equivalent and strictly more powerful than SQ-learning. Yet, computationally, all previously known efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) replicable learning algorithms were confined to SQ-learnable tasks or restricted distributions, in contrast to differentially private learning.   Our main contribution is the first computationally efficient replicable algorithm for realizable learning of parities over arbitrary distributions, a task that is known to be hard in the SQ-model, but possible under differential privacy. This result provides the first evidence that efficient replicable learning over general distributions strictly extends efficient SQ-learning, and is closer in power to efficient differentially private learning, despite computational separations between replicability and privacy. Our main building block is a new, efficient, and replicable algorithm that, given a set of vectors, outputs a subspace of their linear span that covers most of them.",

This model captures environments that are stable except at a few vulnerable points. We introduce \\emph{conditioned occupancy measures}, which remain stable across episodes even with adversarial transitions, and use them to design two algorithms. The first handles arbitrary adversarial steps and achieves regret $\\tilde{O}(H S^Λ\\sqrt{K S A^{Λ+1}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $S$ is the number of state, $A$ is the number of actions and $H$ is the episode's horizon. The second, assuming the adversarial steps are consecutive, improves the dependence on $S$ to $\\tilde{O}(H\\sqrt{K S^{3} A^{Λ+1}})$. We further give a $K^{2/3}$-regret reduction that removes the need to know which steps are the $Λ$ adversarial steps. We also characterize the regret of adversarial MDPs in the \\emph{fully adversarial} setting ($Λ=H-1$) both for full-information and bandit feedback, and provide almost matching upper and lower bounds (slightly strengthen existing lower bounds, and clarify how different feedback structures affect the hardness of learning).",

    "summary": "Steering methods influence Large Language Model behavior by identifying semantic directions in hidden representations, but are typically realized through inference-time activation interventions that apply a fixed, global modification to the model's internal states. While effective, such interventions often induce unfavorable attribute-utility trade-offs under strong control, as they ignore the fact that many behaviors are governed by a small and heterogeneous subset of model components. We propose Steer2Edit, a theoretically grounded, training-free framework that transforms steering vectors from inference-time control signals into diagnostic signals for component-level rank-1 weight editing. Instead of uniformly injecting a steering direction during generation, Steer2Edit selectively redistributes behavioral influence across individual attention heads and MLP neurons, yielding interpretable edits that preserve the standard forward pass and remain compatible with optimized parallel inference. Across safety alignment, hallucination mitigation, and reasoning efficiency, Steer2Edit consistently achieves more favorable attribute-utility trade-offs: at matched downstream performance, it improves safety by up to 17.2%, increases truthfulness by 9.8%, and reduces reasoning length by 12.2% on average. Overall, Steer2Edit provides a principled bridge between representation steering and weight editing by translating steering signals into interpretable, training-free parameter updates.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel prediction-based framework named Contextual and Seasonal LSTMs (CS-LSTMs). CS-LSTMs are built upon a noise decomposition strategy and jointly leverage contextual dependencies and seasonal patterns, thereby strengthening the detection of subtle anomalies. By integrating both time-domain and frequency-domain representations, CS-LSTMs achieve more accurate modeling of periodic trends and anomaly localization.

    "title": "Autoregressive Direct Preference Optimization",
    "summary": "Direct preference optimization (DPO) has emerged as a promising approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, the widespread reliance on the response-level Bradley-Terry (BT) model may limit its full potential, as the reference and learnable models are assumed to be autoregressive only after deriving the objective function. Motivated by this limitation, we revisit the theoretical foundations of DPO and propose a novel formulation that explicitly introduces the autoregressive assumption prior to applying the BT model. By reformulating and extending DPO, we derive a novel variant, termed Autoregressive DPO (ADPO), that explicitly integrates autoregressive modeling into the preference optimization framework. Without violating the theoretical foundations, the derived loss takes an elegant form: it shifts the summation operation in the DPO objective outside the log-sigmoid function. Furthermore, through theoretical analysis of ADPO, we show that there exist two length measures to be considered when designing DPO-based algorithms: the token length $μ$ and the feedback length $μ$'. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explicitly distinguish these two measures and analyze their implications for preference optimization in LLMs.",

    "summary": "Self-Consistency (SC) is an effective decoding strategy that improves the reasoning performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by generating multiple chain-of-thought reasoning paths and selecting the final answer via majority voting. However, it suffers from substantial inference costs because it requires a large number of samples. To mitigate this issue, Difficulty-Adaptive Self-Consistency (DSC) was proposed to reduce unnecessary token usage for easy problems by adjusting the number of samples according to problem difficulty. However, DSC requires additional model calls and pre-sampling to estimate difficulty, and this process is repeated when applying to each dataset, leading to significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose Activation-Informed Difficulty-Aware Self-Consistency (ACTSC) to address these limitations. ACTSC leverages internal difficulty signals reflected in the feed-forward network neuron activations to construct a lightweight difficulty estimation probe, without any additional token generation or model calls. The probe dynamically adjusts the number of samples for SC and can be applied to new datasets without requiring pre-sampling for difficulty estimation. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct experiments on five benchmarks. Experimental results show that ACTSC effectively reduces inference costs while maintaining accuracy relative to existing methods.",

    "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive success across multimodal tasks, but their reliance on visual inputs exposes them to significant adversarial threats. Existing encoder-based attacks perturb the input image by optimizing solely on the vision encoder, rather than the entire LVLM, offering a computationally efficient alternative to end-to-end optimization. However, their transferability across different LVLM architectures in realistic black-box scenarios remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study towards encoder-based adversarial transferability in LVLMs. Our contributions are threefold. First, through large-scale benchmarking over eight diverse LVLMs, we reveal that existing attacks exhibit severely limited transferability. Second, we perform in-depth analysis, disclosing two root causes that hinder the transferability: (1) inconsistent visual grounding across models, where different models focus their attention on distinct regions; (2) redundant semantic alignment within models, where a single object is dispersed across multiple overlapping token representations. Third, we propose Semantic-Guided Multimodal Attack (SGMA), a novel framework to enhance the transferability. Inspired by the discovered causes in our analysis, SGMA directs perturbations toward semantically critical regions and disrupts cross-modal grounding at both global and local levels. Extensive experiments across different victim models and tasks show that SGMA achieves higher transferability than existing attacks. These results expose critical security risks in LVLM deployment and underscore the urgent need for robust multimodal defenses.",

    "summary": "The emergence of multi-agent systems built from large language models (LLMs) offers a promising paradigm for scalable collective intelligence and self-evolution. Ideally, such systems would achieve continuous self-improvement in a fully closed loop while maintaining robust safety alignment--a combination we term the self-evolution trilemma. However, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that an agent society satisfying continuous self-evolution, complete isolation, and safety invariance is impossible. Drawing on an information-theoretic framework, we formalize safety as the divergence degree from anthropic value distributions. We theoretically demonstrate that isolated self-evolution induces statistical blind spots, leading to the irreversible degradation of the system's safety alignment. Empirical and qualitative results from an open-ended agent community (Moltbook) and two closed self-evolving systems reveal phenomena that align with our theoretical prediction of inevitable safety erosion. We further propose several solution directions to alleviate the identified safety concern. Our work establishes a fundamental limit on the self-evolving AI societies and shifts the discourse from symptom-driven safety patches to a principled understanding of intrinsic dynamical risks, highlighting the need for external oversight or novel safety-preserving mechanisms.",

However, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), pretrained on general-domain data, often struggle to capture category-specific anomalies, thereby limiting both detection accuracy and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose Reason-IAD, a knowledge-guided dynamic latent reasoning framework for explainable industrial anomaly detection. Reason-IAD comprises two core components. First, a retrieval-augmented knowledge module incorporates category-specific textual descriptions into the model input, enabling context-aware reasoning over domain-specific defects. Second, an entropy-driven latent reasoning mechanism conducts iterative exploration within a compact latent space using optimizable latent think tokens, guided by an entropy-based reward that encourages confident and stable predictions. Furthermore, a dynamic visual injection strategy selectively incorporates the most informative image patches into the latent sequence, directing the reasoning process toward regions critical for anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Reason-IAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chenpeng052/Reason-IAD.",

    "summary": "The convergence of AI and 6G network automation introduces new challenges in maintaining transparency, fairness, and accountability across multivendor management systems. Although closed-loop AI orchestration improves adaptability and self-optimization, it also creates a responsibility gap, where violations of SLAs cannot be causally attributed to specific agents or vendors. This paper presents a hybrid responsible AI-stochastic learning framework that embeds fairness, robustness, and auditability directly into the network control loop. The framework integrates RAI games with stochastic optimization, enabling dynamic adversarial reweighting and probabilistic exploration across heterogeneous vendor domains. An RAAP continuously records AI-driven decision trajectories and produces dual accountability reports: user-level SLA summaries and operator-level responsibility analytics. Experimental evaluations on synthetic two-class multigroup datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model improves the accuracy of the worst group by up to 10.5\\%. Specifically, hybrid RAI achieved a WGAcc of 60.5\\% and an AvgAcc of 72.7\\%, outperforming traditional RAI-GA (50.0\\%) and ERM (21.5\\%). The audit mechanism successfully traced 99\\% simulated SLA violations to the AI entities responsible, producing both vendor and agent-level accountability indices. These results confirm that the proposed hybrid approach enhances fairness and robustness as well as establishes a concrete accountability framework for autonomous SLA assurance in multivendor 6G networks.",

    "summary": "Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful outputs, yet these defenses remain vulnerable to adversarial prompts. While existing research demonstrates that jailbreak attacks succeed, it does not explain \\textit{where} defenses fail or \\textit{why}.   To address this gap, we propose that LLM safety operates as a sequential pipeline with distinct checkpoints. We introduce the \\textbf{Four-Checkpoint Framework}, which organizes safety mechanisms along two dimensions: processing stage (input vs.\\ output) and detection level (literal vs.\\ intent). This creates four checkpoints, CP1 through CP4, each representing a defensive layer that can be independently evaluated. We design 13 evasion techniques, each targeting a specific checkpoint, enabling controlled testing of individual defensive layers.   Using this framework, we evaluate GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across 3,312 single-turn, black-box test cases. We employ an LLM-as-judge approach for response classification and introduce Weighted Attack Success Rate (WASR), a severity-adjusted metric that captures partial information leakage overlooked by binary evaluation.   Our evaluation reveals clear patterns. Traditional Binary ASR reports 22.6\\% attack success. However, WASR reveals 52.7\\%, a 2.3$\\times$ higher vulnerability. Output-stage defenses (CP3, CP4) prove weakest at 72--79\\% WASR, while input-literal defenses (CP1) are strongest at 13\\% WASR. Claude achieves the strongest safety (42.8\\% WASR), followed by GPT-5 (55.9\\%) and Gemini (59.5\\%).   These findings suggest that current defenses are strongest at input-literal checkpoints but remain vulnerable to intent-level manipulation and output-stage techniques. The Four-Checkpoint Framework provides a structured approach for identifying and addressing safety vulnerabilities in deployed systems.",

    "summary": "Realistic talking-head video generation is critical for virtual avatars, film production, and interactive systems. Current methods struggle with nuanced emotional expressions due to the lack of fine-grained emotion control. To address this issue, we introduce a novel two-stage method (AUHead) to disentangle fine-grained emotion control, i.e. , Action Units (AUs), from audio and achieve controllable generation. In the first stage, we explore the AU generation abilities of large audio-language models (ALMs), by spatial-temporal AU tokenization and an \"emotion-then-AU\" chain-of-thought mechanism. It aims to disentangle AUs from raw speech, effectively capturing subtle emotional cues. In the second stage, we propose an AU-driven controllable diffusion model that synthesizes realistic talking-head videos conditioned on AU sequences. Specifically, we first map the AU sequences into the structured 2D facial representation to enhance spatial fidelity, and then model the AU-vision interaction within cross-attention modules. To achieve flexible AU-quality trade-off control, we introduce an AU disentanglement guidance strategy during inference, further refining the emotional expressiveness and identity consistency of the generated videos. Results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance in emotional realism, accurate lip synchronization, and visual coherence, significantly surpassing existing techniques.

    "summary": "Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to generating fluent yet factually incorrect text-a phenomenon known as hallucinations, undermining their reliability and utility in downstream tasks. We hypothesize that a generated text span's factuality is correlated with its representational instability across the model's internal layers. Based on this, we propose the CoCoA (Confusion and Consistency Aware) decoder, a novel, training-free decoding algorithm that mitigates hallucinations at inference time by listening to these signals in the middle layers. We propose two metrics to quantify this instability in the middle layers, and use it to penalize outputs that exhibit high internal confusion, thereby steering the model towards more internally consistent and factually grounded outputs. We further propose a self-information gated variant, CoCoA-SIG, that dynamically modulates this penalty to selectively target high-surprise, unstable generations. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including question-answering, summarization and code generation demonstrate that CoCoA significantly improves factual correctness across multiple model families (e.g., Llama-3, Qwen-2.5, Mistral). By leveraging model-intrinsic signals, CoCoA offers an effective and broadly applicable method for enhancing the trustworthiness of LLMs at inference time, without requiring any model retraining.",

    "summary": "Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources, flexible loads, and rapidly changing operating conditions make higher-order $N\\!-\\!k$ contingency assessment increasingly important but computationally prohibitive. Exhaustive evaluation of all outage combinations using AC power-flow or ACOPF is infeasible in routine operation. This fact forces operators to rely on heuristic screening methods whose ability to consistently retain all critical contingencies is not formally established. This paper proposes a scalable, state-aware contingency inference framework designed to directly generate high-impact $N\\!-\\!k$ outage scenarios without enumerating the combinatorial contingency space. The framework employs a conditional diffusion model to produce candidate contingencies tailored to the current operating state, while a topology-aware graph neural network trained only on base and $N\\!-\\!1$ cases efficiently constructs high-risk training samples offline. Finally, the framework is developed to provide controllable coverage guarantees for severe contingencies, allowing operators to explicitly manage the risk of missing critical events under limited AC power-flow evaluation budgets. Experiments on IEEE benchmark systems show that, for a given evaluation budget, the proposed approach consistently evaluates higher-severity contingencies than uniform sampling. This allows critical outages to be identified more reliably with reduced computational effort.",

In this paper, we propose Correlation-Aware AMA (CA-AMA), a novel framework that augments AMA with a new correlation-aware payment. We show that any CA-AMA preserves the DSIC property and formalize finding optimal CA-AMA as a constraint optimization problem subject to the IR constraint. Then, we theoretically characterize scenarios where classic AMAs can perform arbitrarily poorly compared to the optimal revenue, while the CA-AMA can reach the optimal revenue. For optimizing CA-AMA, we design a practical two-stage training algorithm. We derive that the target function's continuity and the generalization bound on the degree of deviation from strict IR. Finally, extensive experiments showcase that our algorithm can find an approximate optimal CA-AMA in various distributions with improved revenue and a low degree of violation of IR.",

    "summary": "Robotic laboratories play a critical role in autonomous scientific discovery by enabling scalable, continuous experimental execution. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models offer a promising foundation for robotic laboratories. However, scientific experiments typically involve long-horizon tasks composed of multiple atomic tasks, posing a fundamental challenge to existing VLA models. While VLA models fine-tuned for scientific tasks can reliably execute atomic experimental actions seen during training, they often fail to perform composite tasks formed by reordering and composing these known atomic actions. This limitation arises from a distributional mismatch between training-time atomic tasks and inference-time composite tasks, which prevents VLA models from executing necessary transitional operations between atomic tasks. To address this challenge, we propose an Agentic VLA Inference Plugin for Long-Horizon Tasks in Scientific Experiments. It introduces an LLM-based agentic inference mechanism that intervenes when executing sequential manipulation tasks. By performing explicit transition inference and generating transitional robotic action code, the proposed plugin guides VLA models through missing transitional steps, enabling reliable execution of composite scientific workflows without any additional training. This inference-only intervention makes our method computationally efficient, data-efficient, and well-suited for open-ended and long-horizon robotic laboratory tasks. We build 3D assets of scientific instruments and common scientific operating scenes within an existing simulation environment. In these scenes, we have verified that our method increases the average success rate per atomic task by 42\\% during inference. Furthermore, we show that our method can be easily transferred from the simulation to real scientific laboratories.",

    "summary": "With the rapid advancement of IoT and edge computing, sensor networks have become indispensable, driving the need for large-scale sensor deployment. However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE).",

    "summary": "Deep learning has revolutionized modern society but faces growing energy and latency constraints. Deep physical neural networks (PNNs) are interconnected computing systems that directly exploit analog dynamics for energy-efficient, ultrafast AI execution. Realizing this potential, however, requires universal training methods tailored to physical intricacies. Here, we present the Physical Information Bottleneck (PIB), a general and efficient framework that integrates information theory and local learning, enabling deep PNNs to learn under arbitrary physical dynamics. By allocating matrix-based information bottlenecks to each unit, we demonstrate supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning across electronic memristive chips and optical computing platforms. PIB also adapts to severe hardware faults and allows for parallel training via geographically distributed resources. Bypassing auxiliary digital models and contrastive measurements, PIB recasts PNN training as an intrinsic, scalable information-theoretic process compatible with diverse physical substrates.",

    "summary": "Deep learning has achieved expert-level performance in automated electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, yet the \"black-box\" nature of these models hinders their clinical deployment. Trust in medical AI requires not just high accuracy but also transparency regarding the specific physiological features driving predictions. Existing explainability methods for ECGs typically rely on post-hoc approximations (e.g., Grad-CAM and SHAP), which can be unstable, computationally expensive, and unfaithful to the model's actual decision-making process. In this work, we propose the ECG-IMN, an Interpretable Mesomorphic Neural Network tailored for high-resolution 12-lead ECG classification. Unlike standard classifiers, the ECG-IMN functions as a hypernetwork: a deep convolutional backbone generates the parameters of a strictly linear model specific to each input sample. This architecture enforces intrinsic interpretability, as the decision logic is mathematically transparent and the generated weights (W) serve as exact, high-resolution feature attribution maps. We introduce a transition decoder that effectively maps latent features to sample-wise weights, enabling precise localization of pathological evidence (e.g., ST-elevation, T-wave inversion) in both time and lead dimensions. We evaluate our approach on the PTB-XL dataset for classification tasks, demonstrating that the ECG-IMN achieves competitive predictive performance (AUROC comparable to black-box baselines) while providing faithful, instance-specific explanations. By explicitly decoupling parameter generation from prediction execution, our framework bridges the gap between deep learning capability and clinical trustworthiness, offering a principled path toward \"white-box\" cardiac diagnostics.",

    "summary": "Multi-objective alignment aims to align LLM responses with multiple human preference objectives. Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \\& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.",

    "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling lightweight student networks to benefit from the performance of redundant teacher networks. However, the inherent capacity gap often limits the performance of student networks. Inspired by the expressiveness of pretrained teacher networks, a compelling research question arises: is there a type of network that can not only inherit the teacher's structure but also maximize the inheritance of its knowledge? Furthermore, how does the performance of such an inheriting network compare to that of student networks, all benefiting from the same teacher network? To further explore this question, we propose InherNet, a neural network inheritance method that performs asymmetric low-rank decomposition on the teacher's weights and reconstructs a lightweight yet expressive network without significant architectural disruption. By leveraging Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for initialization to ensure the inheritance of principal knowledge, InherNet effectively balances depth, width, and compression efficiency. Experimental results across unimodal and multimodal tasks demonstrate that InherNet achieves higher performance compared to student networks of similar parameter sizes. Our findings reveal a promising direction for future research in efficient model compression beyond traditional distillation.",

We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that leverages the behavioral patterns induced by safety alignment, applying the concept of refusal vectors for LLM provenance tracking. These vectors, extracted from directional patterns in a model's internal representations when processing harmful versus harmless prompts, serve as robust behavioral fingerprints. Our contribution lies in developing a fingerprinting system around this concept and conducting extensive validation of its effectiveness for IP protection. We demonstrate that these behavioral fingerprints are highly robust against common modifications, including finetunes, merges, and quantization. Our experiments show that the fingerprint is unique to each model family, with low cosine similarity between independently trained models. In a large-scale identification task across 76 offspring models, our method achieves 100\\% accuracy in identifying the correct base model family. Furthermore, we analyze the fingerprint's behavior under alignment-breaking attacks, finding that while performance degrades significantly, detectable traces remain. Finally, we propose a theoretical framework to transform this private fingerprint into a publicly verifiable, privacy-preserving artifact using locality-sensitive hashing and zero-knowledge proofs.",

    "title": "LARV: Data-Free Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer for Model Merging",
    "summary": "Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model without access to training data. Existing task-vector merging methods such as TIES, TSV-M, and Iso-C/CTS differ in their aggregation rules but treat all layers nearly uniformly. This assumption overlooks the strong layer-wise heterogeneity in large vision transformers, where shallow layers are sensitive to interference while deeper layers encode stable task-specific features. We introduce LARV, a training-free, data-free, merger-agnostic Layer-wise Adaptive Rescaling Veneer that plugs into any task-vector merger and assigns a per-layer scale to each task vector before aggregation, and show it consistently boosts diverse merging rules. LARV adaptively suppresses shallow-layer interference and amplifies deeper-layer alignment using a simple deterministic schedule, requiring no retraining or modification to existing mergers. To our knowledge, this is the first work to perform layer-aware scaling for task-vector merging. LARV computes simple data-free layer proxies and turns them into scales through a lightweight rule; we study several instantiations within one framework (e.g., tiered two/three-level scaling with fixed values, or continuous mappings) and show that tiered choices offer the best robustness, while continuous mappings remain an ablation. LARV is orthogonal to the base merger and adds negligible cost. On FusionBench with Vision Transformers, LARV consistently improves all task-vector baselines across 8/14/20-task settings; for example, Iso-C + LARV reaches 85.9% on ViT-B/32, 89.2% on ViT-B/16, and 92.6% on ViT-L/14. Layerwise analysis and corruption tests further indicate that LARV suppresses shallow-layer interference while modestly amplifying deeper, task-stable features, turning model merging into a robust, layer-aware procedure rather than a uniform one.",

    "summary": "The rapid development of visual generative models raises the need for more scalable and human-aligned evaluation methods. While the crowdsourced Arena platforms offer human preference assessments by collecting human votes, they are costly and time-consuming, inherently limiting their scalability. Leveraging vision-language model (VLMs) as substitutes for manual judgments presents a promising solution. However, the inherent hallucinations and biases of VLMs hinder alignment with human preferences, thus compromising evaluation reliability. Additionally, the static evaluation approach lead to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose K-Sort Eval, a reliable and efficient VLM-based evaluation framework that integrates posterior correction and dynamic matching. Specifically, we curate a high-quality dataset from thousands of human votes in K-Sort Arena, with each instance containing the outputs and rankings of K models. When evaluating a new model, it undergoes (K+1)-wise free-for-all comparisons with existing models, and the VLM provide the rankings. To enhance alignment and reliability, we propose a posterior correction method, which adaptively corrects the posterior probability in Bayesian updating based on the consistency between the VLM prediction and human supervision. Moreover, we propose a dynamic matching strategy, which balances uncertainty and diversity to maximize the expected benefit of each comparison, thus ensuring more efficient evaluation. Extensive experiments show that K-Sort Eval delivers evaluation results consistent with K-Sort Arena, typically requiring fewer than 90 model runs, demonstrating both its efficiency and reliability.",

While certified poisoning defenses provide provable robustness bounds for classification tasks, they are fundamentally ill-equipped for autoregressive generation: they cannot handle sequential predictions or the exponentially large output space of language models. To establish a framework for certified natural language generation, we formalize two security properties: stability (robustness to any change in generation) and validity (robustness to targeted, harmful changes in generation). We introduce Targeted Partition Aggregation (TPA), the first algorithm to certify validity/targeted attacks by computing the minimum poisoning budget needed to induce a specific harmful class, token, or phrase. Further, we extend TPA to provide tighter guarantees for multi-turn generations using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Empirically, we demonstrate TPA's effectiveness across diverse settings including: certifying validity of agent tool-calling when adversaries modify up to 0.5% of the dataset and certifying 8-token stability horizons in preference-based alignment. Though inference-time latency remains an open challenge, our contributions enable certified deployment of language models in security-critical applications.",

However, achieving precise control over fine-grained facial movements remains a significant challenge, particularly due to lip-synchronization inaccuracies and facial jitter, both of which can contribute to the uncanny valley effect. To address these challenges, we propose Fine-Grained 3D Gaussian Splatting (FG-3DGS), a novel framework that enables temporally consistent and high-fidelity talking head generation. Our method introduces a frequency-aware disentanglement strategy to explicitly model facial regions based on their motion characteristics. Low-frequency regions, such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead, are jointly modeled using a standard MLP, while high-frequency regions, including the eyes and mouth, are captured separately using a dedicated network guided by facial area masks. The predicted motion dynamics, represented as Gaussian deltas, are applied to the static Gaussians to generate the final head frames, which are rendered via a rasterizer using frame-specific camera parameters. Additionally, a high-frequency-refined post-rendering alignment mechanism, learned from large-scale audio-video pairs by a pretrained model, is incorporated to enhance per-frame generation and achieve more accurate lip synchronization. Extensive experiments on widely used datasets for talking head generation demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches in producing high-fidelity, lip-synced talking head videos.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, which retrieve external knowledge sources to enhance the generative capabilities of LLMs, remain susceptible to the same bias-related challenges. This work focuses on evaluating and understanding the social bias implications of RAG. Through extensive experiments across various retrieval corpora, LLMs, and bias evaluation datasets, encompassing more than 13 different bias types, we surprisingly observe a reduction in bias in RAG. This suggests that the inclusion of external context can help counteract stereotype-driven predictions, potentially improving fairness by diversifying the contextual grounding of the model's outputs. To better understand this phenomenon, we then explore the model's reasoning process by integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting into RAG while assessing the faithfulness of the model's CoT. Our experiments reveal that the model's bias inclinations shift between stereotype and anti-stereotype responses as more contextual information is incorporated from the retrieved documents. Interestingly, we find that while CoT enhances accuracy, contrary to the bias reduction observed with RAG, it increases overall bias across datasets, highlighting the need for bias-aware reasoning frameworks that can mitigate this trade-off.",

    "summary": "Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) is a central tail-risk measure in stochastic structural mechanics, yet its accurate evaluation under high-dimensional, spatially correlated material uncertainty remains computationally prohibitive for classical Monte Carlo methods. Leveraging bounded-expectation reformulations of CVaR compatible with quantum amplitude estimation, we develop a quantum-enhanced inference framework that casts CVaR evaluation as a statistically consistent, confidence-constrained maximum-likelihood amplitude estimation problem. The proposed method extends iterative quantum amplitude estimation (IQAE) by embedding explicit maximum-likelihood inference within a rigorously controlled interval-tracking architecture. To ensure global correctness under finite-shot noise and the non-injective oscillatory response induced by Grover amplification, we introduce a stabilized inference scheme incorporating multi-hypothesis feasibility tracking, periodic low-depth disambiguation, and a bounded restart mechanism governed by an explicit failure-probability budget. This formulation preserves the quadratic oracle-complexity advantage of amplitude estimation while providing finite-sample confidence guarantees and reduced estimator variance. The framework is demonstrated on benchmark problems with spatially correlated lognormal Young's modulus fields generated using a Nystrom low-rank Gaussian kernel model. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator achieves substantially lower oracle complexity than classical Monte Carlo CVaR estimation at comparable confidence levels, while maintaining rigorous statistical reliability.

    "summary": "Many European languages possess rich biblical translation histories, yet existing corpora - in prioritizing linguistic breadth - often fail to capture this depth. To address this gap, we introduce a multilingual corpus of 657 New Testament translations, of which 352 are unique, with unprecedented depth in five languages: English (208 unique versions from 396 total), French (41 from 78), Italian (18 from 33), Polish (30 from 48), and Spanish (55 from 102). Aggregated from 12 online biblical libraries and one preexisting corpus, each translation is manually annotated with metadata that maps the text to a standardized identifier for the work, its specific edition, and its year of revision. This canonicalization empowers researchers to define \"uniqueness\" for their own needs: they can perform micro-level analyses on translation families, such as the KJV lineage, or conduct macro-level studies by deduplicating closely related texts. By providing the first resource designed for such flexible, multilevel analysis, our corpus establishes a new benchmark for the quantitative study of translation history.",

    "summary": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) for large language models (LLMs) updates model parameters at inference time using signals available at deployment. This paper focuses on a common yet under-explored regime: unsupervised, sample-specific TTA, where the model adapts independently for each prompt using only the prompt itself, without gold answers or external supervision. Although appealing, naive unsupervised TTA with a fixed, handcrafted learning rate can be unstable: updates may overfit to prompt-specific statistics, drift from the desired answer distribution, and ultimately degrade generation quality. This failure mode is not surprising, as in this case TTA must adapt to a single prompt within only a few gradient steps, unlike standard training that averages updates over large datasets and long optimization horizons. Therefore, we propose layer-wise dynamic test-time adaptation, a framework which explicitly modulates TTA strength as a function of prompt representation, LLM structure and adaptation step. In our setting, TTA updates only LoRA parameters, and a lightweight hypernetwork predicts per-layer, per-step learning-rate multipliers, enabling fine-grained control. Experiments across various datasets and LLMs consistently show that our method substantially strengthens TTA by learning effective scaling patterns over adaptation steps and transformer layer projections, improving stability while delivering better performance.",

    "summary": "Feature selection (FS) remains essential for building accurate and interpretable detection models, particularly in high-dimensional malware datasets. Conventional FS methods such as Extra Trees, Variance Threshold, Tree-based models, Chi-Squared tests, ANOVA, Random Selection, and Sequential Attention rely primarily on statistical heuristics or model-driven importance scores, often overlooking the semantic context of features. Motivated by recent progress in LLM-driven FS, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can guide feature selection in a zero-shot setting, using only feature names and task descriptions, as a viable alternative to traditional approaches. We evaluate multiple LLMs (GPT-5.0, GPT-4.0, Gemini-2.5 etc.) on the EMBOD dataset (a fusion of EMBER and BODMAS benchmark datasets), comparing them against established FS methods across several classifiers, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, MLP, and KNN. Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC, MCC, and runtime. Our results demonstrate that LLM-guided zero-shot feature selection achieves competitive performance with traditional FS methods while offering additional advantages in interpretability, stability, and reduced dependence on labeled data. These findings position zero-shot LLM-based FS as a promising alternative strategy for effective and interpretable malware detection, paving the way for knowledge-guided feature selection in security-critical applications",

    "summary": "Recent advances in block diffusion language models have demonstrated competitive performance and strong scalability on reasoning tasks. However, existing BDLMs have limited exploration under the test-time scaling setting and face more severe decoding challenges in long Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly in balancing the decoding speed and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a unified framework for test-time scaling in BDLMs that introduces adaptivity in both decoding and block-wise generation. At the decoding level, we propose Bounded Adaptive Confidence Decoding (BACD), a difficulty-aware sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts denoising based on model confidence, accelerating inference while controlling error accumulation. Beyond step-wise adaptivity, we introduce Think Coarse, Critic Fine (TCCF), a test-time scaling paradigm that allocates large block sizes to exploratory reasoning and smaller block sizes to refinement, achieving an effective efficiency-effectiveness balance. To enable efficient and effective decoding with a large block size, we adopt Progressive Block Size Extension, which mitigates performance degradation when scaling block sizes. Extensive experiments show that applying BACD and TCCF to TDAR-8B yields significant improvements over strong baselines such as TraDo-8B (2.26x speedup, +11.2 points on AIME24). These results mark an important step toward unlocking the potential of BDLMs for test-time scaling in complex reasoning tasks.",

    "summary": "To expand the applicability of decentralized online learning, previous studies have proposed several algorithms for decentralized online continuous submodular maximization (D-OCSM) -- a non-convex/non-concave setting with continuous DR-submodular reward functions. However, there exist large gaps between their approximate regret bounds and the regret bounds achieved in the convex setting. Moreover, if focusing on projection-free algorithms, which can efficiently handle complex decision sets, they cannot even recover the approximate regret bounds achieved in the centralized setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate that for D-OCSM over general convex decision sets, these two issues can be addressed simultaneously. Furthermore, for D-OCSM over downward-closed decision sets, we show that the second issue can be addressed while significantly alleviating the first issue. Our key techniques are two reductions from D-OCSM to decentralized online convex optimization (D-OCO), which can exploit D-OCO algorithms to improve the approximate regret of D-OCSM in these two cases, respectively.",

    "summary": "In streaming Reinforcement Learning (RL), transitions are observed and discarded immediately after a single update. While this minimizes resource usage for on-device applications, it makes agents notoriously sample-inefficient, since value-based losses alone struggle to extract meaningful representations from transient data. We propose extending Self-Predictive Representations (SPR) to the streaming pipeline to maximize the utility of every observed frame. However, due to the highly correlated samples induced by the streaming regime, naively applying this auxiliary loss results in training instabilities. Thus, we introduce orthogonal gradient updates relative to the momentum target and resolve gradient conflicts arising from streaming-specific optimizers. Validated across the Atari, MinAtar, and Octax suites, our approach systematically outperforms existing streaming baselines. Latent-space analysis, including t-SNE visualizations and effective-rank measurements, confirms that our method learns significantly richer representations, bridging the performance gap caused by the absence of a replay buffer, while remaining efficient enough to train on just a few CPU cores.",

    "summary": "Due to the scarcity of part-of-speech annotated data, existing studies on low-resource languages typically adopt unsupervised approaches for POS tagging. Among these, POS tag projection with word alignment method transfers POS tags from a high-resource source language to a low-resource target language based on parallel corpora, making it particularly suitable for low-resource language settings. However, this approach relies heavily on parallel corpora, which are often unavailable for many low-resource languages. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully unsupervised cross-lingual part-of-speech(POS) tagging framework that relies solely on monolingual corpora by leveraging unsupervised neural machine translation(UNMT) system. This UNMT system first translates sentences from a high-resource language into a low-resource one, thereby constructing pseudo-parallel sentence pairs. Then, we train a POS tagger for the target language following the standard projection procedure based on word alignments. Moreover, we propose a multi-source projection technique to calibrate the projected POS tags on the target side, enhancing to train a more effective POS tagger. We evaluate our framework on 28 language pairs, covering four source languages (English, German, Spanish and French) and seven target languages (Afrikaans, Basque, Finnis, Indonesian, Lithuanian, Portuguese and Turkish). Experimental results show that our method can achieve performance comparable to the baseline cross-lingual POS tagger with parallel sentence pairs, and even exceeds it for certain target languages. Furthermore, our proposed multi-source projection technique further boosts performance, yielding an average improvement of 1.3% over previous methods.",

Our study focuses on understanding the reasoning behind image formation through denoising trajectory of diffusion model and subsequently prototype explainability with faithfulness analysis. Experimental analysis shows that EPPNet achieves the highest faithfulness (with score 0.1534), offering more reliable insights, and explainability into the generative process. The results highlight that diffusion models can be made more transparent and trustworthy through faithfulness-based explanations, contributing to safer and more interpretable applications of generative AI in healthcare.",

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security.",

A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks.   Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation.   We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability.

In long-horizon TIR trajectories, an early irrecoverable mistake can determine success or failure, making it crucial to localize the first irrecoverable step and leverage it for fine-grained credit assignment. We propose Error-Localized Policy Optimization (ELPO), which localizes the first irrecoverable step via binary-search rollout trees under a fixed rollout budget, converts the resulting tree into stable learning signals through hierarchical advantage attribution, and applies error-localized adaptive clipping to strengthen corrective updates on the critical step and its suffix. Across TIR benchmarks in math, science QA, and code execution, ELPO consistently outperforms strong Agentic RL baselines under comparable sampling budgets, with additional gains in Pass@K and Major@K scaling, rollout ranking quality, and tool-call efficiency.

Yet, their deployment in multilingual legal settings is constrained by unreliable retrieval and the lack of domain-adapted, open-embedding models. In particular, existing multilingual legal corpora are not designed for semantic retrieval, and PDF-based legislative sources introduce substantial noise due to imperfect text extraction. To address these challenges, we introduce LEMUR, a large-scale multilingual corpus of EU environmental legislation constructed from 24,953 official EUR-Lex PDF documents covering 25 languages. We quantify the fidelity of PDF-to-text conversion by measuring lexical consistency against authoritative HTML versions using the Lexical Content Score (LCS). Building on LEMUR, we fine-tune three state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models using contrastive objectives in both monolingual and bilingual settings, reflecting realistic legal-retrieval scenarios. Experiments across low- and high-resource languages demonstrate that legal-domain fine-tuning consistently improves Top-k retrieval accuracy relative to strong baselines, with particularly pronounced gains for low-resource languages. Cross-lingual evaluations show that these improvements transfer to unseen languages, indicating that fine-tuning primarily enhances language-independent, content-level legal representations rather than language-specific cues.

Most research focuses on specific pollutant categories and employs variations of YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet architectures. Although several datasets exist, they are limited to specific areas and lack standardized taxonomies. Few studies integrate detection into real-time application systems, yet they tend to be geographically skewed. We proposed a framework for monitoring visual pollution that integrates a visual pollution index to assess the severity of visual pollution for a certain area. This review highlights the need for a unified UVP management system that incorporates pollutant taxonomy, a cross-city benchmark dataset, a generalized deep learning model, and an assessment index that supports sustainable urban aesthetics and enhances the well-being of urban dwellers.",

    "summary": "Discrete diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful class of generative models for chemistry and biology data. In these fields, the goal is to generate various samples with high rewards (e.g., drug-likeness in molecules), making reward-based guidance crucial. Most existing methods are based on guiding the diffusion model using intermediate rewards but tend to underperform since intermediate rewards are noisy due to the non-smooth nature of reward functions used in scientific domains. To address this, we propose Clean-Sample Markov Chain (CSMC) Sampler, a method that performs effective test-time reward-guided sampling for discrete diffusion models, enabling local search without relying on intermediate rewards. CSMC constructs a Markov chain of clean samples using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm such that its stationary distribution is the target distribution. We design a proposal distribution by sequentially applying the forward and backward diffusion processes, making the acceptance probability tractable.

    "summary": "Today's business organizations need access control systems that can handle complex, changing security requirements that go beyond what traditional methods can manage. Current approaches, such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), and Discretionary Access Control (DAC), were designed for specific purposes. They cannot effectively manage the dynamic, situation-dependent workflows that modern systems require. In this research, we introduce LLMAC, a new unified approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to combine these different access control methods into one comprehensive, understandable system. We used an extensive synthetic dataset that represents complex real-world scenarios, including policies for ownership verification, version management, workflow processes, and dynamic role separation. Using Mistral 7B, our trained LLM model achieved outstanding results with 98.5% accuracy, significantly outperforming traditional methods (RBAC: 14.5%, ABAC: 58.5%, DAC: 27.5%) while providing clear, human readable explanations for each decision. Performance testing shows that the system can be practically deployed with reasonable response times and computing resources.",

Existing solutions of automated toxicity detection systems, are based on a machine or deep learning algorithms.

In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring.

    "summary": "Reliable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems depend fundamentally on the retriever's ability to find relevant information. We show that neural retrievers used in RAG systems have blind spots, which we define as the failure to retrieve entities that are relevant to the query, but have low similarity to the query embedding. We investigate the training-induced biases that cause such blind spot entities to be mapped to inaccessible parts of the embedding space, resulting in low retrievability. Using a large-scale dataset constructed from Wikidata relations and first paragraphs of Wikipedia, and our proposed Retrieval Probability Score (RPS), we show that blind spot risk in standard retrievers (e.g., CONTRIEVER, REASONIR) can be predicted pre-index from entity embedding geometry, avoiding expensive retrieval evaluations. To address these blind spots, we introduce ARGUS, a pipeline that enables the retrievability of high-risk (low-RPS) entities through targeted document augmentation from a knowledge base (KB), first paragraphs of Wikipedia, in our case. Extensive experiments on BRIGHT, IMPLIRET, and RAR-B show that ARGUS achieves consistent improvements across all evaluated retrievers (averaging +3.4 nDCG@5 and +4.5 nDCG@10 absolute points), with substantially larger gains in challenging subsets. These results establish that preemptively remedying blind spots is critical for building robust and trustworthy RAG systems (Code and Data).",

Our self-supervised models adapt to input operators using coarse spectral information (e.g., eigenvalue estimates and residual norms), and they predict recurrence coefficients for computing or applying a matrix polynomial tailored to a downstream task. The effectiveness of AutoSpec relies on three ingredients: an architecture whose inference pass implements short, executable numerical linear algebra recurrences; efficient training on small synthetic problems with transfer to large-scale real-world operators; and task-defined objectives that enforce the desired approximation or preconditioning behavior across the range of spectral profiles represented in the training set. We apply AutoSpec to discovering algorithms for representative numerical linear algebra tasks: accelerating matrix-function approximation; accelerating sparse linear solvers; and spectral filtering/preconditioning for eigenvalue computations. On real-world matrices, the learned procedures deliver orders-of-magnitude improvements in accuracy and/or reductions in iteration count, relative to basic baselines. We also find clear connections to classical theory: the induced polynomials often exhibit near-equiripple, near-minimax behavior characteristic of Chebyshev polynomials.",

    "summary": "Watermarking is an important mechanism for provenance and copyright protection of diffusion-generated images. Training-free methods, exemplified by Gaussian Shading, embed watermarks into the initial noise of diffusion models with negligible impact on the quality of generated images. However, extracting this type of watermark typically requires multi-step diffusion inversion to obtain precise initial noise, which is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose One-step Inversion (OSI), a significantly faster and more accurate method for extracting Gaussian Shading style watermarks. OSI reformulates watermark extraction as a learnable sign classification problem, which eliminates the need for precise regression of the initial noise. Then, we initialize the OSI model from the diffusion backbone and finetune it on synthesized noise-image pairs with a sign classification objective. In this manner, the OSI model is able to accomplish the watermark extraction efficiently in only one step. Our OSI substantially outperforms the multi-step diffusion inversion method: it is 20x faster, achieves higher extraction accuracy, and doubles the watermark payload capacity. Extensive experiments across diverse schedulers, diffusion backbones, and cryptographic schemes consistently show improvements, demonstrating the generality of our OSI framework.",

In response, we revisit Design-by-Analogy (DbA), a cognitively grounded approach that fosters novel solutions by mapping inspiration across domains. However, prevailing perspectives often restrict DbA to early ideation or specific data modalities, while reducing AI-driven design to simplified input-output pipelines. Such conceptual limitations inadvertently foster widespread design fixation. To address this, we expand the understanding of DbA by embedding it into the entire creative process, thereby demonstrating its capacity to mitigate such fixation. Through a systematic review of 85 studies, we identify six forms of representation and classify techniques across seven stages of the creative process. We further discuss three major application domains: creative industries, intelligent manufacturing, and education and services, demonstrating DbA's practical relevance. Building on this synthesis, we frame DbA as a mediating technology for human-AI collaboration and outline the potential opportunities and inherent risks for advancing creativity support in HCI and design research.",

Current systems have a core representational mismatch: content is time-varying, while speaker identity is injected as a static global embedding. We introduce a streamable speech synthesizer that aligns the temporal granularity of identity and content via a content-synchronous, time-varying timbre (TVT) representation. A Global Timbre Memory expands a global timbre instance into multiple compact facets; frame-level content attends to this memory, a gate regulates variation, and spherical interpolation preserves identity geometry while enabling smooth local changes. In addition, a factorized vector-quantized bottleneck regularizes content to reduce residual speaker leakage. The resulting system is streamable end-to-end, with <80 ms GPU latency. Experiments show improvements in naturalness, speaker transfer, and anonymization compared to SOTA streaming baselines, establishing TVT as a scalable approach for privacy-preserving and expressive speech synthesis under strict latency budgets.",

    "summary": "Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic paradigm for deciding the funding of public projects given the residents' preferences, which has been adopted in numerous cities across the world. The main focus of PB is designing rules, functions that return feasible budget allocations for a set of projects subject to some budget constraint. Designing PB rules that optimize both utility and fairness objectives based on agent preferences had been challenging due to the extensive domain knowledge required and the proven trade-off between the two notions. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for automated algorithmic design. Given the resemblance of PB rules to algorithms for classical knapsack problems, in this paper, we introduce a novel framework, named LLMRule, that addresses the limitations of existing works by incorporating LLMs into an evolutionary search procedure for automating the design of PB rules. Our experimental results, evaluated on more than 600 real-world PB instances obtained from the U.S., Canada, Poland, and the Netherlands with different representations of agent preferences, demonstrate that the LLM-generated rules generally outperform existing handcrafted rules in terms of overall utility while still maintaining a similar degree of fairness.",

    "summary": "Human activity recognition (HAR) on wearable and mobile devices is constrained by memory footprint and computational budget, yet competitive accuracy must be maintained across heterogeneous sensor configurations. Selective state space models (SSMs) offer linear time sequence processing with input dependent gating, presenting a compelling alternative to quadratic complexity attention mechanisms. However, the design space for deploying SSMs in the TinyML regime remains largely unexplored. In this paper, BabyMamba-HAR is introduced, a framework comprising two novel lightweight Mamba inspired architectures optimized for resource constrained HAR: (1) CI-BabyMamba-HAR, using a channel independent stem that processes each sensor channel through shared weight, but instance independent transformations to prevent cross channel noise propagation, and (2) Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR, using an early fusion stem that achieves channel count independent computational complexity. Both variants incorporate weight tied bidirectional scanning and lightweight temporal attention pooling. Through evaluation across eight diverse benchmarks, it is demonstrated that Crossover-BiDir-BabyMamba-HAR achieves 86.52% average macro F1-score with approximately 27K parameters and 2.21M MACs, matching TinyHAR (86.16%) while requiring 11x fewer MACs on high channel datasets. Systematic ablation studies reveal that bidirectional scanning contributes up to 8.42% F1-score improvement, and gated temporal attention provides up to 8.94% F1-score gain over mean pooling. These findings establish practical design principles for deploying selective state space models as efficient TinyML backbones for HAR.",

Namely, the need for named-entity recognition of academic entities within questions and multi-faceted data retrieval involving scientometric indices, e.g. impact factors. Beyond their exceptional capacity for treating traditional natural language processing tasks, LLMs have shown great potential in more complex applications, such as task decomposition and planning and reasoning. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs to scientometric question answering, and describe an end-to-end system implementing a sequential workflow with retrieval-augmented generation and agentic concepts. We also address the secondary task of effectively synthesizing the data into presentable and well-structured high-level analyses. As a database for retrieval-augmented generation, we leverage a proprietary research performance assessment platform.

    "summary": "High-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) from real-world videos is crucial for applications such as cultural heritage preservation, digital twins, and immersive media. However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.",

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.",

The generation process is conditioned on both the text for semantics and the 2D strokes for explicit structural control, with the VAE's decoder reconstructing the final high-quality 3D skeleton; and 2) Enhanced Mesh Synthesis via TextuRig and SKA-DPO, where we then synthesize a textured mesh conditioned on the generated skeleton. For this stage, we first enhance an existing skeleton-to-mesh model by augmenting its training data with TextuRig: a dataset of textured and rigged meshes with captions, curated from Objaverse-XL. Additionally, we employ a preference optimization strategy, SKA-DPO, guided by a skeleton-mesh alignment score, to further improve geometric fidelity. Together, our framework enables a more intuitive workflow for creating ready to animate 3D content. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to generate rigged 3D meshes conditioned on user-drawn 2D strokes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Stroke3D produces plausible skeletons and high-quality meshes.",

    "summary": "Effectively scaling GUI automation is essential for computer-use agents (CUAs); however, existing work primarily focuses on scaling GUI grounding rather than the more crucial GUI planning, which requires more sophisticated data collection. In reality, the exploration process of a CUA across apps/desktops/web pages typically follows a tree structure, with earlier functional entry points often being explored more frequently. Thus, organizing large-scale trajectories into tree structures can reduce data cost and streamline the data scaling of GUI planning. In this work, we propose TreeCUA to efficiently scale GUI automation with tree-structured verifiable evolution. We propose a multi-agent collaborative framework to explore the environment, verify actions, summarize trajectories, and evaluate quality to generate high-quality and scalable GUI trajectories. To improve efficiency, we devise a novel tree-based topology to store and replay duplicate exploration nodes, and design an adaptive exploration algorithm to balance the depth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory difficulty) and breadth (\\emph{i.e.}, trajectory diversity). Moreover, we develop world knowledge guidance and global memory backtracking to avoid low-quality generation. Finally, we naturally extend and propose the TreeCUA-DPO method from abundant tree node information, improving GUI planning capability by referring to the branch information of adjacent trajectories. Experimental results show that TreeCUA and TreeCUA-DPO offer significant improvements, and out-of-domain (OOD) studies further demonstrate strong generalization. All trajectory node information and code will be available at https://github.com/UITron-hub/TreeCUA.",

Though length control methods have been proposed, it remains unclear what the optimal output length is for balancing efficiency and performance. In this work, we compare several length control methods on two models, Qwen3-1.7B Base and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B. Our results indicate that length penalties may hinder reasoning acquisition, while properly tuned length control can improve efficiency for models with strong prior reasoning. By extending prior work to RL trained policies, we identify two failure modes, 1) long outputs increase dispersion, and 2) short outputs lead to under-thinking.",

However, their use in high-stakes fields like healthcare remains limited due to persistent hallucinations, where generated text contradicts or ignores visual input. We contend that MLLMs can comprehend images but struggle to produce accurate token sequences. Minor perturbations can shift attention from truthful to untruthful states, and the autoregressive nature of text generation often prevents error correction. To address this, we propose SchröMind-a novel framework reducing hallucinations via solving the Schrödinger bridge problem. It establishes a token-level mapping between hallucinatory and truthful activations with minimal transport cost through lightweight training, while preserving the model's original capabilities. Extensive experiments on the POPE and MME benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of Schrödinger, which achieves state-of-the-art performance while introducing only minimal computational overhead.",

    "summary": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex tasks by employing search-augmented reasoning to incorporate external knowledge into long chains of thought. However, we identify a critical yet underexplored bottleneck in this paradigm, termed Knowledge Integration Decay (KID). Specifically, we observe that as the length of reasoning generated before search grows, models increasingly fail to integrate retrieved evidence into subsequent reasoning steps, limiting performance even when relevant information is available. To address this, we propose Self-Anchored Knowledge Encoding (SAKE), a training-free inference-time strategy designed to stabilize knowledge utilization. By anchoring retrieved knowledge at both the beginning and end of the reasoning process, SAKE prevents it from being overshadowed by prior context, thereby preserving its semantic integrity. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA and complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SAKE significantly mitigates KID and improves performance, offering a lightweight yet effective solution for knowledge integration in agentic LLMs.",

    "title": "Equilibrium contrastive learning for imbalanced image classification",
    "summary": "Contrastive learning (CL) is a predominant technique in image classification, but they showed limited performance with an imbalanced dataset. Recently, several supervised CL methods have been proposed to promote an ideal regular simplex geometric configuration in the representation space-characterized by intra-class feature collapse and uniform inter-class mean spacing, especially for imbalanced datasets. In particular, existing prototype-based methods include class prototypes, as additional samples to consider all classes. However, the existing CL methods suffer from two limitations. First, they do not consider the alignment between the class means/prototypes and classifiers, which could lead to poor generalization. Second, existing prototype-based methods treat prototypes as only one additional sample per class, making their influence depend on the number of class instances in a batch and causing unbalanced contributions across classes. To address these limitations, we propose Equilibrium Contrastive Learning (ECL), a supervised CL framework designed to promote geometric equilibrium, where class features, means, and classifiers are harmoniously balanced under data imbalance. The proposed ECL framework uses two main components. First, ECL promotes the representation geometric equilibrium (i.e., a regular simplex geometry characterized by collapsed class samples and uniformly distributed class means), while balancing the contributions of class-average features and class prototypes. Second, ECL establishes a classifier-class center geometric equilibrium by aligning classifier weights and class prototypes. We ran experiments with three long-tailed datasets, the CIFAR-10(0)-LT, ImageNet-LT, and the two imbalanced medical datasets, the ISIC 2019 and our constructed LCCT dataset. Results show that ECL outperforms existing SOTA supervised CL methods designed for imbalanced classification.",

    "summary": "Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) generate text by iteratively filling masked tokens, requiring two coupled decisions at each step: which positions to unmask (where-to-unmask) and which tokens to place (what-to-unmask). While standard MDLM training directly optimizes token prediction (what-to-unmask), inference-time unmasking orders (where-to-unmask) are typically determined by heuristic confidence measures or trained through reinforcement learning with costly on-policy rollouts. To address this, we introduce Gt-Margin, a position-wise score derived from ground-truth tokens, defined as the probability margin between the correct token and its strongest alternative. Gt-Margin yields an oracle unmasking order that prioritizes easier positions first under each partially masked state. We demonstrate that leveraging this oracle unmasking order significantly enhances final generation quality, particularly on logical reasoning benchmarks. Building on this insight, we train a supervised unmasking planner via learning-to-rank to imitate the oracle ordering from masked contexts. The resulting planner integrates into standard MDLM sampling to select where-to-unmask, improving reasoning accuracy without modifying the token prediction model.",

Evaluating them requires approximating a large number of conditional expectations, either via Monte Carlo integration or regression. Until recently it has not been possible to fully exploit deep learning for the regression approach, because retraining for each conditional expectation takes too long. Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime. We discuss further improvements and how tabular foundation models can be better adapted specifically for conditional Shapley value estimation.",

Building on the batch-to-online conversion by Dong and Yoshida (2023), we show that if an offline algorithm admits a $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation guarantee and the effect of $\\varepsilon$ on its average sensitivity is characterized by a function $\\varphi(\\varepsilon)$, then an adaptive choice of $\\varepsilon$ yields a small-loss regret bound of $\\tilde O(\\varphi^{\\star}(\\mathrm{OPT}_T))$, where $\\varphi^{\\star}$ is the concave conjugate of $\\varphi$, $\\mathrm{OPT}_T$ is the offline optimum over $T$ rounds, and $\\tilde O$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $T$. Our method requires no regularity assumptions on loss functions, such as smoothness, and can be viewed as a generalization of the AdaGrad-style tuning applied to the approximation parameter $\\varepsilon$. Our result recovers and strengthens the $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate regret bounds of Dong and Yoshida (2023) and yields small-loss regret bounds for online $k$-means clustering, low-rank approximation, and regression. We further apply our framework to online submodular function minimization using $(1\\pm\\varepsilon)$-cut sparsifiers of submodular hypergraphs, obtaining a small-loss regret bound of $\\tilde O(n^{3/4}(1 + \\mathrm{OPT}_T^{3/4}))$, where $n$ is the ground-set size.

However, existing contrastive and masked autoencoder methods typically rely on naive random dropping or masking for augmentation, which is ill-suited for brain graphs and hypergraphs as it disrupts semantically meaningful connectivity patterns. Moreover, commonly used graph-level readout and reconstruction schemes fail to capture global structural information, limiting the robustness of learned representations. In this work, we propose a unified diffusion-based pretraining framework that addresses both limitations. First, diffusion is designed to guide structure-aware dropping and masking strategies, preserving brain graph semantics while maintaining effective pretraining diversity. Second, diffusion enables topology-aware graph-level readout and node-level global reconstruction by allowing graph embeddings and masked nodes to aggregate information from globally related regions. Extensive experiments across multiple neuroimaging datasets with over 25,000 subjects and 60,000 scans involving various mental disorders and brain atlases demonstrate consistent performance improvements.",

Most studies on LSC focus on improving the performance of estimating the degree of LSC, however, it is often difficult to interpret how the meaning of a word change. Enhancing the interpretability of LSC is a significant challenge as it could lead to novel insights in this field. To tackle this challenge, we propose a method to map the semantic space of contextualized embeddings of words obtained by a pre-trained language model to a neurobiological feature space. In the neurobiological feature space, each dimension corresponds to a primitive feature of words, and its value represents the intensity of that feature. This enables humans to interpret LSC systematically. When employed for the estimation of the degree of LSC, our method demonstrates superior performance in comparison to the majority of the previous methods. In addition, given the high interpretability of the proposed method, several analyses on LSC are carried out. The results demonstrate that our method not only discovers interesting types of LSC that have been overlooked in previous studies but also effectively searches for words with specific types of LSC.",

    "summary": "Since 1887, administrative law has navigated a \"capability-accountability trap\": technological change forces government to become more sophisticated, but sophistication renders agencies opaque to generalist overseers like the courts and Congress. The law's response--substituting procedural review for substantive oversight--has produced a sedimentary accretion of requirements that ossify capacity without ensuring democratic control. This Article argues that the Supreme Court's post-Loper Bright retrenchment is best understood as an effort to shrink administration back to comprehensible size in response to this complexification. But reducing complexity in this way sacrifices capability precisely when climate change, pandemics, and AI risks demand more sophisticated governance.   AI offers a different path. Unlike many prior administrative technologies that increased opacity alongside capacity, AI can help build \"scrutability\" in government, translating technical complexity into accessible terms, surfacing the assumptions that matter for oversight, and enabling substantive verification of agency reasoning. This Article proposes three doctrinal innovations within administrative law to realize this potential: a Model and System Dossier (documenting model purpose, evaluation, monitoring, and versioning) extending the administrative record to AI decision-making; a material-model-change trigger specifying when AI updates require new process; and a \"deference to audit\" standard that rewards agencies for auditable evaluation of their AI tools. The result is a framework for what this Article calls the \"Fourth Settlement,\" administrative law that escapes the capability-accountability trap by preserving capability while restoring comprehensible oversight of administration.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have substantially improved visual fidelity and temporal coherence. However, most existing approaches remain task-specific and rely primarily on textual instructions, limiting their ability to handle multimodal inputs, contextual references, and diverse video generation and editing scenarios within a unified framework. Moreover, many video editing methods depend on carefully engineered pipelines tailored to individual operations, which hinders scalability and composability. In this paper, we propose Tele-Omni, a unified multimodal framework for video generation and editing that follows multimodal instructions, including text, images, and reference videos, within a single model. Tele-Omni leverages pretrained multimodal large language models to parse heterogeneous instructions and infer structured generation or editing intents, while diffusion-based generators perform high-quality video synthesis conditioned on these structured signals. To enable joint training across heterogeneous video tasks, we introduce a task-aware data processing pipeline that unifies multimodal inputs into a structured instruction format while preserving task-specific constraints. Tele-Omni supports a wide range of video-centric tasks, including text-to-video generation, image-to-video generation, first-last-frame video generation, in-context video generation, and in-context video editing. By decoupling instruction parsing from video synthesis and combining it with task-aware data design, Tele-Omni achieves flexible multimodal control while maintaining strong temporal coherence and visual consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that Tele-Omni achieves competitive performance across multiple tasks.",

We demonstrate that, unlike in the image domain where deep generative models frequently assign higher likelihoods to anomalous data, such counterintuitive behavior occurs far less often in tabular settings. We first introduce a domain-agnostic formulation that enables consistent detection and evaluation of the counterintuitive phenomenon, addressing the absence of precise definition. Through extensive experiments on 47 tabular datasets and 10 CV/NLP embedding datasets in ADBench, benchmarked against 13 baseline models, we demonstrate that the phenomenon, as defined, is consistently rare in general tabular data. We further investigate this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives, focusing on the roles of data dimensionality and difference in feature correlation. Our results suggest that likelihood-only detection with normalizing flows offers a practical and reliable approach for anomaly detection in tabular domains.",

By anchoring the neural tangent kernel with positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images of interest, we arrive at formulating the affinity between images as a coupling of their visual proximity and semantic overlap. We show that this formulation amplifies within-cluster connections while suppressing spurious ones across clusters, hence encouraging block-diagonal structures. In addition, we present a regularized affinity diffusion mechanism that adaptively ensembles affinity matrices induced by different prompts. Extensive experiments on \\textbf{16} benchmarks -- including classical, large-scale, fine-grained and domain-shifted datasets -- manifest that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin.",

    "summary": "Deep generative models that can tractably compute input likelihoods, including normalizing flows, often assign unexpectedly high likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We mitigate this likelihood paradox by manipulating input entropy based on semantic similarity, applying stronger perturbations to inputs that are less similar to an in-distribution memory bank. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that entropy control increases the expected log-likelihood gap between in-distribution and OOD samples in favor of the in-distribution, and we explain why the procedure works without any additional training of the density model. We then evaluate our method against likelihood-based OOD detectors on standard benchmarks and find consistent AUROC improvements over baselines, supporting our explanation.",

    "summary": "Tree-search decoding is an effective form of test-time scaling for large language models (LLMs), but real-world deployment imposes a fixed per-query token budget that varies across settings. Existing tree-search policies are largely budget-agnostic, treating the budget as a termination condition, which can lead to late-stage over-branching or premature termination. We propose {Budget-Guided MCTS} (BG-MCTS), a tree-search decoding algorithm that aligns its search policy with the remaining token budget: it starts with broad exploration, then prioritizes refinement and answer completion as the budget depletes while reducing late-stage branching from shallow nodes. BG-MCTS consistently outperforms budget-agnostic tree-search baselines across different budgets on MATH500 and AIME24/25 with open-weight LLMs.",

    "summary": "Conversational question answering increasingly relies on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground large language models (LLMs) in external knowledge. Yet, most existing studies evaluate RAG methods in isolation and primarily focus on single-turn settings. This paper addresses the lack of a systematic comparison of RAG methods for multi-turn conversational QA, where dialogue history, coreference, and shifting user intent substantially complicate retrieval. We present a comprehensive empirical study of vanilla and advanced RAG methods across eight diverse conversational QA datasets spanning multiple domains. Using a unified experimental setup, we evaluate retrieval quality and answer generation using generator and retrieval metrics, and analyze how performance evolves across conversation turns. Our results show that robust yet straightforward methods, such as reranking, hybrid BM25, and HyDE, consistently outperform vanilla RAG. In contrast, several advanced techniques fail to yield gains and can even degrade performance below the No-RAG baseline. We further demonstrate that dataset characteristics and dialogue length strongly influence retrieval effectiveness, explaining why no single RAG strategy dominates across settings. Overall, our findings indicate that effective conversational RAG depends less on method complexity than on alignment between the retrieval strategy and the dataset structure. We publish the code used.\\footnote{\\href{https://github.com/Klejda-A/exp-rag.git}{GitHub Repository}}",

To address this, we propose RAD, a retrieval-augmented framework that approximates the benefits of multi-view stereo by utilizing retrieved neighbors as structural geometric proxies. Our method first employs an uncertainty-aware retrieval mechanism to identify low-confidence regions in the input and retrieve RGB-D context samples containing semantically similar content. We then process both the input and retrieved context via a dual-stream network and fuse them using a matched cross-attention module, which transfers geometric information only at reliable point correspondences. Evaluations on NYU Depth v2, KITTI, and Cityscapes demonstrate that RAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on underrepresented classes, reducing relative absolute error by 29.2% on NYU Depth v2, 13.3% on KITTI, and 7.2% on Cityscapes, while maintaining competitive performance on standard in-domain benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Multimodal representation learning aims to construct a shared embedding space in which heterogeneous modalities are semantically aligned. Despite strong empirical results, InfoNCE-based objectives introduce inherent conflicts that yield distribution gaps across modalities. In this work, we identify two conflicts in the multimodal regime, both exacerbated as the number of modalities increases: (i) an alignment-uniformity conflict, whereby the repulsion of uniformity undermines pairwise alignment, and (ii) an intra-alignment conflict, where aligning multiple modalities induces competing alignment directions. To address these issues, we propose a principled decoupling of alignment and uniformity for multimodal representations, providing a conflict-free recipe for multimodal learning that simultaneously supports discriminative and generative use cases without task-specific modules. We then provide a theoretical guarantee that our method acts as an efficient proxy for a global Hölder divergence over multiple modality distributions, and thus reduces the distribution gap among modalities. Extensive experiments on retrieval and UnCLIP-style generation demonstrate consistent gains.",

Using financial prediction tasks, we show that revealing the downstream use (e.g., predicting stock returns or earnings) of LLM outputs leads the LLM to generate biased sentiment and competition measures, even though these measures are intended to be downstream task-independent. Goal-aware prompting shifts intermediate measures toward the disclosed downstream objective. This purpose leakage improves performance before the LLM's knowledge cutoff, but with no advantage post-cutoff.

    "summary": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive coding capabilities, their ability to autonomously build production-scale software from explicit specifications remains an open question. We introduce SWE-AGI, an open-source benchmark for evaluating end-to-end, specification-driven construction of software systems written in MoonBit. SWE-AGI tasks require LLM-based agents to implement parsers, interpreters, binary decoders, and SAT solvers strictly from authoritative standards and RFCs under a fixed API scaffold. Each task involves implementing 1,000-10,000 lines of core logic, corresponding to weeks or months of engineering effort for an experienced human developer. By leveraging the nascent MoonBit ecosystem, SWE-AGI minimizes data leakage, forcing agents to rely on long-horizon architectural reasoning rather than code retrieval. Across frontier models, gpt-5.3-codex achieves the best overall performance (solving 19/22 tasks, 86.4%), outperforming claude-opus-4.6 (15/22, 68.2%), and kimi-2.5 exhibits the strongest performance among open-source models. Performance degrades sharply with increasing task difficulty, particularly on hard, specification-intensive systems. Behavioral analysis further reveals that as codebases scale, code reading, rather than writing, becomes the dominant bottleneck in AI-assisted development. Overall, while specification-driven autonomous software engineering is increasingly viable, substantial challenges remain before it can reliably support production-scale development.",

    "summary": "With the rapid development and uptake of large language models (LLMs) across high-stakes settings, it is increasingly important to ensure that LLMs behave in ways that align with human values. Existing moral benchmarks prompt LLMs with value statements, moral scenarios, or psychological questionnaires, with the implicit underlying assumption that LLMs report somewhat stable moral preferences. However, moral psychology research has shown that human moral judgements are sensitive to morally irrelevant situational factors, such as smelling cinnamon rolls or the level of ambient noise, thereby challenging moral theories that assume the stability of human moral judgements. Here, we draw inspiration from this \"situationist\" view of moral psychology to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit similar cognitive moral biases to humans. We curate a novel multimodal dataset of 60 \"moral distractors\" from existing psychological datasets of emotionally-valenced images and narratives which have no moral relevance to the situation presented. After injecting these distractors into existing moral benchmarks to measure their effects on LLM responses, we find that moral distractors can shift the moral judgements of LLMs by over 30% even in low-ambiguity scenarios, highlighting the need for more contextual moral evaluations and more nuanced cognitive moral modeling of LLMs.",

We establish an information-theoretic barrier to this credit assignment problem: the signal connecting early steps to final outcomes decays exponentially with depth, creating a critical horizon beyond which no algorithm can learn from endpoint data alone. We prove four results. First, a Signal Decay Bound: sample complexity for attributing outcomes to early stages grows exponentially in the number of intervening steps. Second, Width Limits: parallel rollouts provide only logarithmic relief, with correlation capping the effective number of independent samples. Third, an Objective Mismatch: additive reward aggregation optimizes the wrong quantity when sequential validity requires all steps to be correct. Fourth, Optimal Inspection Design: uniform checkpoint spacing is minimax-optimal under homogeneous signal attenuation, while a greedy algorithm yields optimal non-uniform schedules under heterogeneous attenuation. Together, these results provide a common analytical foundation for inspection design in operations and supervision design in AI.",

To further expand the range of languages these models can support, many works focus on continued pre-training of these models. However, few works address how to extend mPLMs to low-resource languages that were previously unsupported. To tackle this issue, we expand the model's vocabulary using a target language corpus. We then screen out a subset from the model's original vocabulary, which is biased towards representing the source language(e.g. English), and utilize bilingual dictionaries to initialize the representations of the expanded vocabulary. Subsequently, we continue to pre-train the mPLMs using the target language corpus, based on the representations of these expanded vocabulary. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline, which uses randomly initialized expanded vocabulary for continued pre-training, in POS tagging and NER tasks, achieving improvements by 0.54% and 2.60%, respectively. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high robustness in selecting the training corpora, and the models' performance on the source language does not degrade after continued pre-training.",

Progress in AI-assisted psychiatric diagnosis is constrained by the absence of benchmarks that simultaneously provide realistic patient simulation, clinician-verified diagnostic labels, and support for dynamic multi-turn consultation. We present LingxiDiagBench, a large-scale multi-agent benchmark that evaluates LLMs on both static diagnostic inference and dynamic multi-turn psychiatric consultation in Chinese. At its core is LingxiDiag-16K, a dataset of 16,000 EMR-aligned synthetic consultation dialogues designed to reproduce real clinical demographic and diagnostic distributions across 12 ICD-10 psychiatric categories. Through extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs, we establish key findings: (1) although LLMs achieve high accuracy on binary depression--anxiety classification (up to 92.3%), performance deteriorates substantially for depression--anxiety comorbidity recognition (43.0%) and 12-way differential diagnosis (28.5%); (2) dynamic consultation often underperforms static evaluation, indicating that ineffective information-gathering strategies significantly impair downstream diagnostic reasoning; (3) consultation quality assessed by LLM-as-a-Judge shows only moderate correlation with diagnostic accuracy, suggesting that well-structured questioning alone does not ensure correct diagnostic decisions.

It employs a DAG-based architecture with explicit state transitions to ensure determinism and recoverability. The pipeline builds a domain ontology and Person-Centric Entity Graph, defines tool interfaces via Service Blueprints for Model Context Protocol servers, and populates environments with consistent databases and strict Domain Policies. A cross-domain fusion mechanism links services to simulate complex tasks. Finally, the pipeline creates user tasks by verifying solution paths, filtering via execution-based validation, and generating queries using a Persona-based Simulator for automated rollout. This produces reliable environments with clear state changes. To demonstrate effectiveness, we synthesized $\\approx$ 11K interaction samples; experimental results indicate that models trained on this dataset achieve significant improvements on function calling over baselines, particularly in larger parameter regimes.",

    "summary": "This study examines the extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) capture geographic lexical variation in Spanish, a language that exhibits substantial regional variation. Treating LLMs as virtual informants, we probe their dialectal knowledge using two survey-style question formats: Yes-No questions and multiple-choice questions. To this end, we exploited a large-scale, expert-curated database of Spanish lexical variation. Our evaluation covers more than 900 lexical items across 21 Spanish-speaking countries and is conducted at both the country and dialectal area levels. Across both evaluation formats, the results reveal systematic differences in how LLMs represent Spanish language varieties. Lexical variation associated with Spain, Equatorial Guinea, Mexico & Central America, and the La Plata River is recognized more accurately by the models, while the Chilean variety proves particularly difficult for the models to distinguish. Importantly, differences in the volume of country-level digital resources do not account for these performance patterns, suggesting that factors beyond data quantity shape dialectal representation in LLMs. By providing a fine-grained, large-scale evaluation of geographic lexical variation, this work advances empirical understanding of dialectal knowledge in LLMs and contributes new evidence to discussions of Digital Linguistic Bias in Spanish.",

    "title": "Where Are We At with Automatic Speech Recognition for the Bambara Language?",
    "summary": "This paper introduces the first standardized benchmark for evaluating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in the Bambara language, utilizing one hour of professionally recorded Malian constitutional text. Designed as a controlled reference set under near-optimal acoustic and linguistic conditions, the benchmark was used to evaluate 37 models, ranging from Bambara-trained systems to large-scale commercial models. Our findings reveal that current ASR performance remains significantly below deployment standards in a narrow formal domain; the top-performing system in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) achieved 46.76\\% and the best Character Error Rate (CER) of 13.00\\% was set by another model, while several prominent multilingual models exceeded 100\\% WER. These results suggest that multilingual pre-training and model scaling alone are insufficient for underrepresented languages. Furthermore, because this dataset represents a best-case scenario of the most simplified and formal form of spoken Bambara, these figures are yet to be tested against practical, real-world settings. We provide the benchmark and an accompanying public leaderboard to facilitate transparent evaluation and future research in Bambara speech technology.",

    "summary": "The transition toward low-inertia power systems demands modeling frameworks that provide not only accurate state predictions but also physically consistent sensitivities for control. While scientific machine learning offers powerful nonlinear modeling tools, the control-oriented implications of different differentiable paradigms remain insufficiently understood. This paper presents a comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs), and Differentiable Programming (DP) for modeling, identification, and control of power system dynamics. Using the Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) system as a benchmark, we evaluate their performance in trajectory extrapolation, parameter estimation, and Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) synthesis.   Our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between data-driven flexibility and physical structure. NODE exhibits superior extrapolation by capturing the underlying vector field, whereas PINN shows limited generalization due to its reliance on a time-dependent solution map. In the inverse problem of parameter identification, while both DP and PINN successfully recover the unknown parameters, DP achieves significantly faster convergence by enforcing governing equations as hard constraints. Most importantly, for control synthesis, the DP framework yields closed-loop stability comparable to the theoretical optimum. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NODE serves as a viable data-driven surrogate when governing equations are unavailable.",

    "summary": "The Rashomon set captures the collection of models that achieve near-identical empirical performance yet may differ substantially in their decision boundaries. Understanding the differences among these models, i.e., their multiplicity, is recognized as a crucial step toward model transparency, fairness, and robustness, as it reveals decision boundaries instabilities that standard metrics obscure. However, the existing definitions of Rashomon set and multiplicity metrics assume centralized learning and do not extend naturally to decentralized, multi-party settings like Federated Learning (FL). In FL, multiple clients collaboratively train models under a central server's coordination without sharing raw data, which preserves privacy but introduces challenges from heterogeneous client data distribution and communication constraints. In this setting, the choice of a single best model may homogenize predictive behavior across diverse clients, amplify biases, or undermine fairness guarantees. In this work, we provide the first formalization of Rashomon sets in FL.First, we adapt the Rashomon set definition to FL, distinguishing among three perspectives: (I) a global Rashomon set defined over aggregated statistics across all clients, (II) a t-agreement Rashomon set representing the intersection of local Rashomon sets across a fraction t of clients, and (III) individual Rashomon sets specific to each client's local distribution.Second, we show how standard multiplicity metrics can be estimated under FL's privacy constraints. Finally, we introduce a multiplicity-aware FL pipeline and conduct an empirical study on standard FL benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that all three proposed federated Rashomon set definitions offer valuable insights, enabling clients to deploy models that better align with their local data, fairness considerations, and practical requirements.",

    "summary": "Long-horizon planning is widely recognized as a core capability of autonomous LLM-based agents; however, current evaluation frameworks suffer from being largely episodic, domain-specific, or insufficiently grounded in persistent economic dynamics. We introduce EcoGym, a generalizable benchmark for continuous plan-and-execute decision making in interactive economies. EcoGym comprises three diverse environments: Vending, Freelance, and Operation, implemented in a unified decision-making process with standardized interfaces, and budgeted actions over an effectively unbounded horizon (1000+ steps if 365 day-loops for evaluation). The evaluation of EcoGym is based on business-relevant outcomes (e.g., net worth, income, and DAU), targeting long-term strategic coherence and robustness under partial observability and stochasticity. Experiments across eleven leading LLMs expose a systematic tension: no single model dominates across all three scenarios. Critically, we find that models exhibit significant suboptimality in either high-level strategies or efficient actions executions. EcoGym is released as an open, extensible testbed for transparent long-horizon agent evaluation and for studying controllability-utility trade-offs in realistic economic settings.",

    "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLM) enable non-experts to specify open-world multi-robot tasks, the generated plans often lack kinematic feasibility and are not efficient, especially in long-horizon scenarios. Formal methods like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) offer correctness and optimal guarantees, but are typically confined to static, offline settings and struggle with computational scalability. To bridge this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework that grounds LLM reasoning into hierarchical LTL specifications and solves the corresponding Simultaneous Task Allocation and Planning (STAP) problem. Unlike static approaches, our system resolves stochastic environmental changes, such as moving users or updated instructions via a receding horizon planning (RHP) loop with real-time perception, which dynamically refines plans through a hierarchical state space. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in success rate and interaction fluency while minimizing planning latency.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multicultural settings; however, systematic evaluation of cultural specificity at the sentence level remains underexplored. We propose the Conceptual Cultural Index (CCI), which estimates cultural specificity at the sentence level. CCI is defined as the difference between the generality estimate within the target culture and the average generality estimate across other cultures. This formulation enables users to operationally control the scope of culture via comparison settings and provides interpretability, since the score derives from the underlying generality estimates. We validate CCI on 400 sentences (200 culture-specific and 200 general), and the resulting score distribution exhibits the anticipated pattern: higher for culture-specific sentences and lower for general ones. For binary separability, CCI outperforms direct LLM scoring, yielding more than a 10-point improvement in AUC for models specialized to the target culture.

    "summary": "Discovering configurations that are both high-utility and structurally diverse under expensive black-box evaluation and strict query budgets remains a central challenge in data-driven discovery. Many classical optimizers concentrate on dominant modes, while quality-diversity methods require large evaluation budgets to populate high-dimensional archives. Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) provides distributional sampling but requires an explicit problem Hamiltonian, which is unavailable in black-box settings. Practical quantum circuits favor quadratic Hamiltonians since higher-order interaction terms are costly to realize. Learned quadratic surrogates such as Factorization Machines (FM) have been used as proxies, but are limited to pairwise structure. We extend this surrogate-to-Hamiltonian approach by modelling higher-order variable dependencies via self-attention and projects them into a valid Positive Semi-Definite quadratic form compatible with QAOA. This enables diversity-oriented quantum sampling from learned energy landscapes while capturing interaction structure beyond pairwise terms. We evaluate on risk discovery for enterprise document processing systems against diverse classical optimizers. Quantum-guided samplers achieve competitive utility while consistently improving structural diversity and exclusive discovery. FM surrogates provide stronger early coverage, whereas ours yields higher-fidelity surrogate landscapes and better extreme-case discovery. Our method recovers roughly twice as many structurally tail-risk outliers as most classical baselines and identify an exclusive non-overlapping fraction of high-utility configurations not found by competing methods, highlighting that an effective mechanism for learning higher-order interaction structure and projecting it into quadratic surrogate Hamiltonians for quantum-assisted black-box discovery.",

    "title": "Fully-automated sleep staging: multicenter validation of a generalizable deep neural network for Parkinson's disease and isolated REM sleep behavior disorder",
    "summary": "Isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a key prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD), and video-polysomnography (vPSG) remains the diagnostic gold standard. However, manual sleep staging is particularly challenging in neurodegenerative diseases due to EEG abnormalities and fragmented sleep, making PSG assessments a bottleneck for deploying new RBD screening technologies at scale. We adapted U-Sleep, a deep neural network, for generalizable sleep staging in PD and iRBD. A pretrained U-Sleep model, based on a large publicly available, multisite non-neurodegenerative dataset (PUB; 19,236 PSGs across 12 sites), was fine-tuned on research datasets from two centers (Lundbeck Foundation Parkinson's Disease Research Center (PACE) and the Cologne-Bonn Cohort (CBC); 112 PD, 138 iRBD, 89 age-matched controls. The resulting model was evaluated on an independent dataset from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM; 81 PD, 36 iRBD, 87 sleep-clinic controls). A subset of PSGs with low agreement between the human rater and the model (\\k{appa} < 0.6) was re-scored by a second blinded human rater to identify sources of disagreement. Finally, we applied confidence-based thresholds to optimize REM sleep staging. The pretrained model achieved mean \\k{appa} = 0.81 in PUB, but \\k{appa} = 0.66 when applied directly to PACE/CBC. By fine-tuning the model, we developed a generalized model with \\k{appa} = 0.74 on PACE/CBC (p < 0.001 vs. the pretrained model). In DCSM, mean and median \\k{appa} increased from 0.60 to 0.64 (p < 0.001) and 0.64 to 0.69 (p < 0.001), respectively. In the interrater study, PSGs with low agreement between the model and the initial scorer showed similarly low agreement between human scorers. Applying a confidence threshold increased the proportion of correctly identified REM sleep epochs from 85% to 95.5%, while preserving sufficient (> 5 min) REM sleep for 95% of subjects.",

The usual specification of constraints in most CASP solvers is closer to the numerical back-end expressiveness and semantics, rather than to standard specification in ASP. In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes. In this paper, we present the FLINGO language (and tool) that incorporates the aforementioned expressiveness inside the numerical constraints and we illustrate its use with several examples. Based on previous work that established its semantic foundations, we also present a translation from the newly introduced FLINGO syntax to regular CASP programs following the CLINGCON input format.",

    "summary": "A challenge in mitigating social bias in fine-tuned language models (LMs) is the potential reduction in language modeling capability, which can harm downstream performance. Counterfactual data augmentation (CDA), a widely used method for fine-tuning, highlights this issue by generating synthetic data that may align poorly with real-world distributions or creating overly simplistic counterfactuals that ignore the social context of altered sensitive attributes (e.g., gender) in the pretraining corpus. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective context-augmented CDA method, Context-CDA, which uses large LMs to enhance the diversity and contextual relevance of the debiasing corpus. By minimizing discrepancies between the debiasing corpus and pretraining data through augmented context, this approach ensures better alignment, enhancing language modeling capability. We then employ uncertainty-based filtering to exclude generated counterfactuals considered low-quality by the target smaller LMs (i.e., LMs to be debiased), further improving the fine-tuning corpus quality. Experimental results on gender bias benchmarks demonstrate that Context-CDA effectively mitigates bias without sacrificing language modeling performance while offering insights into social biases by analyzing distribution shifts in next-token generation probabilities.",

    "summary": "The purpose of predictive modeling on relational data is to predict future or missing values in a relational database, for example, future purchases of a user, risk of readmission of the patient, or the likelihood that a financial transaction is fraudulent. Typically powered by machine learning methods, predictive models are used in recommendations, financial fraud detection, supply chain optimization, and other systems, providing billions of predictions every day. However, training a machine learning model requires manual work to extract the required training examples - prediction entities and target labels - from the database, which is slow, laborious, and prone to mistakes. Here, we present the Predictive Query Language (PQL), a SQL-inspired declarative language for defining predictive tasks on relational databases. PQL allows specifying a predictive task in a single declarative query, enabling the automatic computation training labels for a large variety of machine learning tasks, such as regression, classification, time-series forecasting, and recommender systems. PQL is already successfully integrated and used in a collection of use cases as part of a predictive AI platform. The versatility of the language can be demonstrated through its many ongoing use cases, including financial fraud, item recommendations, and workload prediction. We demonstrate its versatile design through two implementations; one for small-scale, low-latency use and one that can handle large-scale databases.",

    "title": "Bridging Efficiency and Transparency: Explainable CoT Compression in Multimodal Large Reasoning Models",
    "summary": "Long chains of thought (Long CoTs) are widely employed in multimodal reasoning models to tackle complex tasks by capturing detailed visual information. However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.",

    "summary": "Synthetic data provide low-cost, accurately annotated samples for geometry-sensitive vision tasks, but appearance and imaging differences between synthetic and real domains cause severe domain shift and degrade downstream performance. Unpaired synthetic-to-real translation can reduce this gap without paired supervision, yet existing methods often face a trade-off between photorealism and structural stability: unconstrained generation may introduce deformation or spurious textures, while overly rigid constraints limit adaptation to real-domain statistics. We propose FD-DB, a frequency-decoupled dual-branch model that separates appearance transfer into low-frequency interpretable editing and high-frequency residual compensation. The interpretable branch predicts physically meaningful editing parameters (white balance, exposure, contrast, saturation, blur, and grain) to build a stable low-frequency appearance base with strong content preservation. The free branch complements fine details through residual generation, and a gated fusion mechanism combines the two branches under explicit frequency constraints to limit low-frequency drift. We further adopt a two-stage training schedule that first stabilizes the editing branch and then releases the residual branch to improve optimization stability. Experiments on the YCB-V dataset show that FD-DB improves real-domain appearance consistency and significantly boosts downstream semantic segmentation performance while preserving geometric and semantic structures.",

    "summary": "Vericoding refers to the generation of formally verified code from rigorous specifications. Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers.

    "summary": "World-model-based imagine-then-act becomes a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, yet existing approaches typically support either purely image-based forecasting or reasoning over partial 3D geometry, limiting their ability to predict complete 4D scene dynamics. This work proposes a novel embodied 4D world model that enables geometrically consistent, arbitrary-view RGBD generation: given only a single-view RGBD observation as input, the model imagines the remaining viewpoints, which can then be back-projected and fused to assemble a more complete 3D structure across time. To efficiently learn the multi-view, cross-modality generation, we explicitly design cross-view and cross-modality feature fusion that jointly encourage consistency between RGB and depth and enforce geometric alignment across views. Beyond prediction, converting generated futures into actions is often handled by inverse dynamics, which is ill-posed because multiple actions can explain the same transition. We address this with a test-time action optimization strategy that backpropagates through the generative model to infer a trajectory-level latent best matching the predicted future, and a residual inverse dynamics model that turns this trajectory prior into accurate executable actions. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate strong performance on both 4D scene generation and downstream manipulation, and ablations provide practical insights into the key design choices.",

    "summary": "Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.   In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.   The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.",

    "summary": "Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) pose significant security and reliability risks in real-world applications. Inspired by the observation that humans are more error-prone when uncertain or hesitant, we investigate how instability in a model 's internal knowledge contributes to LVLM hallucinations. We conduct extensive empirical analyses from three perspectives, namely attention heads, model layers, and decoding tokens, and identify three key hallucination patterns: (i) visual activation drift across attention heads, (ii) pronounced knowledge fluctuations across layers, and (iii) visual focus distraction between neighboring output tokens. Building on these findings, we propose Stability-Aware Knowledge-Enhanced Decoding (SAKED), which introduces a layer-wise Knowledge Stability Score (KSS) to quantify knowledge stability throughout the model. By contrasting the most stability-aware and stability-agnostic layers, SAKED suppresses decoding noise and dynamically leverages the most reliable internal knowledge for faithful token generation. Moreover, SAKED is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into different architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAKED achieves state-of-the-art performance for hallucination mitigation on various models, tasks, and benchmarks.",

We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \\emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \\emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \\textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.",

To bridge this gap, we first develop a novel three-stage pipeline to synthesize a million-scale image-description dataset. The pipeline leverages multiple general-purpose MLLMs as weak annotators, refines their outputs through consensus fusion and expert knowledge injection, and produces high-fidelity descriptions of cell morphology. Using this dataset, we then fine-tune the Qwen3-VL-4B model via a multi-stage strategy to create a specialized cytopathology MLLM. The resulting model, named Singpath-VL, demonstrates superior performance in fine-grained morphological perception and cell-level diagnostic classification. To advance the field, we will open-source a portion of the synthetic dataset and benchmark.",

Deep analysis on multi-hop data reveals that diversity benefit correlates strongly with query complexity ($r$$\\geq$0.95, $p$$<$0.05 in 12/14 conditions), measured by content words (CW). We formalize this as the Complexity-Diversity Principle (CDP): query complexity determines optimal diversity. CDP provides actionable thresholds (CW$>$10: use diversity; CW$<$7: avoid it).

    "summary": "As artificial intelligence systems evolve from passive assistants into autonomous agents capable of executing consequential actions, the security boundary shifts from model outputs to tool execution. Traditional security paradigms - log aggregation, perimeter defense, and post-hoc forensics - cannot protect systems where AI-driven actions are irreversible, execute at machine speed, and originate from potentially compromised orchestration layers. This paper introduces Autonomous Action Runtime Management (AARM), an open specification for securing AI-driven actions at runtime. AARM defines a runtime security system that intercepts actions before execution, accumulates session context, evaluates against policy and intent alignment, enforces authorization decisions, and records tamper-evident receipts for forensic reconstruction. We formalize a threat model addressing prompt injection, confused deputy attacks, data exfiltration, and intent drift. We introduce an action classification framework distinguishing forbidden, context-dependent deny, and context-dependent allow actions. We propose four implementation architectures - protocol gateway, SDK instrumentation, kernel eBPF, and vendor integration - with distinct trust properties, and specify minimum conformance requirements for AARM-compliant systems. AARM is model-agnostic, framework-agnostic, and vendor-neutral, treating action execution as the stable security boundary. This specification aims to establish industry-wide requirements before proprietary fragmentation forecloses interoperability.",

A core challenge it faces is bias, which has primarily been studied in terms of known biases and their impact on evaluation outcomes, while automated and systematic exploration of potential unknown biases is still lacking. Nevertheless, such exploration is crucial for enhancing the robustness and reliability of evaluations. To bridge this gap, we propose BiasScope, a LLM-driven framework for automatically and at scale discovering potential biases that may arise during model evaluation. BiasScope can uncover potential biases across different model families and scales, with its generality and effectiveness validated on the JudgeBench dataset. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches, transforming bias discovery from a passive process relying on manual effort and predefined bias lists into an active and comprehensive automated exploration. Moreover, based on BiasScope, we propose JudgeBench-Pro, an extended version of JudgeBench and a more challenging benchmark for evaluating the robustness of LLM-as-a-judge. Strikingly, even powerful LLMs as evaluators show error rates above 50\\% on JudgeBench-Pro, underscoring the urgent need to strengthen evaluation robustness and to mitigate potential biases further.",

However, existing methods exhibit limited exploitation of temporal correlations, causing noticeable flicker and degraded temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates. In this paper, we propose Free-GVC, a training-free generative video compression framework that reformulates video coding as latent trajectory compression guided by a video diffusion prior. Our method operates at the group-of-pictures (GOP) level, encoding video segments into a compact latent space and progressively compressing them along the diffusion trajectory. To ensure perceptually consistent reconstruction across GOPs, we introduce an Adaptive Quality Control module that dynamically constructs an online rate-perception surrogate model to predict the optimal diffusion step for each GOP. In addition, an Inter-GOP Alignment module establishes frame overlap and performs latent fusion between adjacent groups, thereby mitigating flicker and enhancing temporal coherence. Experiments show that Free-GVC achieves an average of 93.29% BD-Rate reduction in DISTS over the latest neural codec DCVC-RT, and a user study further confirms its superior perceptual quality and temporal coherence at ultra-low bitrates.",

    "summary": "Circuit discovery and activation steering in transformers have developed as separate research threads, yet both operate on the same representational space. Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in imaging technologies, deep learning and numerical performance have enabled non-invasive detailed analysis of artworks, supporting their documentation and conservation. In particular, automated detection of craquelure in digitized paintings is crucial for assessing degradation and guiding restoration, yet remains challenging due to the possibly complex scenery and the visual similarity between cracks and crack-like artistic features such as brush strokes or hair. We propose a hybrid approach that models crack detection as an inverse problem, decomposing an observed image into a crack-free painting and a crack component. A deep generative model is employed as powerful prior for the underlying artwork, while crack structures are captured using a Mumford--Shah-type variational functional together with a crack prior. Joint optimization yields a pixel-level map of crack localizations in the painting.",

We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

To the best of our knowledge, this issue has not yet been addressed in the context of isolation-based methods, and this paper represents the first attempt to do so. This paper introduces an Extended Isolation Forest with feature sensitivities, which we refer to as the Anisotropic Isolation Forest (AIF). In contrast to the standard EIF, the AIF enables anomaly detection with controllable sensitivity to deviations in different features or directions in the feature space. The paper also introduces novel measures of directional sensitivity, which allow quantification of AIF's sensitivity in different directions in the feature space. These measures enable adjustment of the AIF's sensitivity to task-specific requirements. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm by applying it to synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that the AIF enables anomaly detection that focuses on directions in the feature space where deviations from typical behavior are more important.",

    "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a tool to compress a larger system (teacher) into a smaller one (student). In machine translation, studies typically report only the translation quality of the student and omit the computational complexity of performing KD, making it difficult to select among the many available KD choices under compute-induced constraints. In this study, we evaluate representative KD methods by considering both translation quality and computational cost. We express computational cost as a carbon footprint using the machine learning life cycle assessment (MLCA) tool. This assessment accounts for runtime operational emissions and amortized hardware production costs throughout the KD model life cycle (teacher training, distillation, and inference). We find that (i) distillation overhead dominates the total footprint at small deployment volumes, (ii) inference dominates at scale, making KD beneficial only beyond a task-dependent usage threshold, and (iii) word-level distillation typically offers more favorable footprint-quality trade-offs than sequence-level distillation. Our protocol provides reproducible guidance for selecting KD methods under explicit quality and compute-induced constraints.",

    "summary": "Diffusion models do not recover semantic structure uniformly over time. Instead, samples transition from semantic ambiguity to class commitment within a narrow regime. Recent theoretical work attributes this transition to dynamical instabilities along class-separating directions, but practical methods to detect and exploit these windows in trained models are still limited. We show that tracking the class-conditional entropy of a latent semantic variable given the noisy state provides a reliable signature of these transition regimes. By restricting the entropy to semantic partitions, the entropy can furthermore resolve semantic decisions at different levels of abstraction. We analyze this behavior in high-dimensional Gaussian mixture models and show that the entropy rate concentrates on the same logarithmic time scale as the speciation symmetry-breaking instability previously identified in variance-preserving diffusion. We validate our method on EDM2-XS and Stable Diffusion 1.5, where class-conditional entropy consistently isolates the noise regimes critical for semantic structure formation. Finally, we use our framework to quantify how guidance redistributes semantic information over time. Together, these results connect information-theoretic and statistical physics perspectives on diffusion and provide a principled basis for time-localized control.",

    "summary": "Real-world contact-rich manipulation demands robots to perceive temporal tactile feedback, capture subtle surface deformations, and reason about object properties as well as force dynamics. Although optical tactile sensors are uniquely capable of providing such rich information, existing tactile datasets and models remain limited. These resources primarily focus on object-level attributes (e.g., material) while largely overlooking fine-grained tactile temporal dynamics during physical interactions. We consider that advancing dynamic tactile perception requires a systematic hierarchy of dynamic perception capabilities to guide both data collection and model design. To address the lack of tactile data with rich dynamic information, we present ToucHD, a large-scale hierarchical tactile dataset spanning tactile atomic actions, real-world manipulations, and touch-force paired data. Beyond scale, ToucHD establishes a comprehensive tactile dynamic data ecosystem that explicitly supports hierarchical perception capabilities from the data perspective. Building on it, we propose AnyTouch 2, a general tactile representation learning framework for diverse optical tactile sensors that unifies object-level understanding with fine-grained, force-aware dynamic perception. The framework captures both pixel-level and action-specific deformations across frames, while explicitly modeling physical force dynamics, thereby learning multi-level dynamic perception capabilities from the model perspective. We evaluate our model on benchmarks that covers static object properties and dynamic physical attributes, as well as real-world manipulation tasks spanning multiple tiers of dynamic perception capabilities-from basic object-level understanding to force-aware dexterous manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate consistent and strong performance across sensors and tasks.",

    "summary": "Correctly detecting radar targets is usually challenged by clutter and waveform distortion. An additional difficulty stems from the relative proximity of several targets, the latter being perceived as a single target in the worst case, or influencing each other's detection thresholds. The negative impact of targets proximity notably depends on the range resolution defined by the radar parameters and the adaptive threshold adopted. This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters. Whereas the pulse compression processes one pulse length at a time, the neural network put forward is a generative architecture going through the entire received signal in one go to generate a complete detection profile.",

Their output constitutes an approximation of statistically dominant word patterns. And yet, the drafting of contracts is often presented as a typical legal task that could be facilitated by this technology. This paper seeks to put an end to such unreasonable ideas. Predicting words differs from using language in the circumstances of specific transactions and reconstituting common contractual phrases differs from reasoning about the law. LLMs seem to be able to generate generic and superficially plausible contractual documents. In the cold light of day, such documents may turn out to be useless assemblages of inconsistent provisions or contracts that are enforceable but unsuitable for a given transaction. This paper casts a shadow on the simplistic assumption that LLMs threaten the continued viability of the legal industry.",

    "summary": "Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications.

    "summary": "Most self-supervised learning (SSL) methods learn continuous visual representations by aligning different views of the same input, offering limited control over how information is structured across representation dimensions. In this work, we frame visual self-supervised learning as a discrete communication process between a teacher and a student network, where semantic information is transmitted through a fixed-capacity binary channel. Rather than aligning continuous features, the student predicts multi-label binary messages produced by the teacher. Discrete agreement is enforced through an element-wise binary cross-entropy objective, while a coding-rate regularization term encourages effective utilization of the constrained channel, promoting structured representations. We further show that periodically reinitializing the projection head strengthens this effect by encouraging embeddings that remain predictive across multiple discrete encodings. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over continuous agreement baselines on image classification, retrieval, and dense visual prediction tasks, as well as under domain shift through self-supervised adaptation. Beyond backbone representations, we analyze the learned binary codes and show that they form a compact and informative discrete language, capturing semantic factors reusable across classes.",

Previous research primarily focused on learning affordance knowledge from static cues such as language and images, which struggle to provide sufficient dynamic interaction context that can reveal temporal and causal cues. To alleviate this predicament, we collect a comprehensive video-based 3D affordance dataset, \\textit{VIDA}, which contains 38K human-object-interaction videos covering 16 affordance types, 38 object categories, and 22K point clouds. Based on \\textit{VIDA}, we propose a strong baseline: VideoAfford, which activates multimodal large language models with additional affordance segmentation capabilities, enabling both world knowledge reasoning and fine-grained affordance grounding within a unified framework. To enhance action understanding capability, we leverage a latent action encoder to extract dynamic interaction priors from HOI videos. Moreover, we introduce a \\textit{spatial-aware} loss function to enable VideoAfford to obtain comprehensive 3D spatial knowledge. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms well-established methods and exhibits strong open-world generalization with affordance reasoning abilities.

    "summary": "Digital histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) provide gigapixel-scale high-resolution images that are highly useful for disease diagnosis. However, digital histopathology image analysis faces significant challenges due to the limited training labels, since manually annotating specific regions or small patches cropped from large WSIs requires substantial time and effort. Weakly supervised multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a practical and efficient solution by requiring only bag-level (slide-level) labels, while each bag typically contains multiple instances (patches). Most MIL methods directly use frozen image patch features generated by various image encoders as inputs and primarily focus on feature aggregation. However, feature representation learning for encoder pretraining in MIL settings has largely been neglected.   In our work, we propose a novel feature representation learning framework called weakly supervised contrastive learning (WeakSupCon) that incorporates bag-level label information during training. Our method does not rely on instance-level pseudo-labeling, yet it effectively separates patches with different labels in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that the image features generated by our WeakSupCon method lead to improved downstream MIL performance compared to self-supervised contrastive learning approaches in three datasets.

    "summary": "A 3D understanding of anatomy is central to diagnosis and treatment planning, yet volumetric imaging remains costly with long wait times. Image-to-3D foundations models can solve this issue by reconstructing 3D data from 2D modalites. Current foundation models are trained on natural image distributions to reconstruct naturalistic objects from a single image by leveraging geometric priors across pixels. However, it is unclear whether these learned geometric priors transfer to medical data. In this study, we present a controlled zero-shot benchmark of single slice medical image-to-3D reconstruction across five state-of-the-art image-to-3D models: SAM3D, Hunyuan3D-2.1, Direct3D, Hi3DGen, and TripoSG. These are evaluated across six medical datasets spanning anatomical and pathological structures and two natrual datasets, using voxel based metrics and point cloud distance metrics. Across medical datasets, voxel based overlap remains moderate for all models, consistent with a depth reconstruction failure mode when inferring volume from a single slice. In contrast, global distance metrics show more separation between methods: SAM3D achieves the strongest overall topological similarity to ground truth medical 3D data, while alternative models are more prone to over-simplication of reconstruction. Our results quantify the limits of single-slice medical reconstruction and highlight depth ambiguity caused by the planar nature of 2D medical data, motivating multi-view image-to-3D reconstruction to enable reliable medical 3D inference.",

    "summary": "We study an online learning problem with multiple correct answers, where each instance admits a set of valid labels, and in each round the learner must output a valid label for the queried example. This setting is motivated by language generation tasks, in which a prompt may admit many acceptable completions, but not every completion is acceptable. We study this problem under three feedback models. For each model, we characterize the optimal mistake bound in the realizable setting using an appropriate combinatorial dimension. We then establish a trichotomy of regret bounds across the three models in the agnostic setting. Our results also imply sample complexity bounds for the batch setup that depend on the respective combinatorial dimensions.",

We identify a key quantity that, for each method, describes how the performance degrades as the step size becomes too large. For convex problems, we show that this quantity directly impacts the suboptimality bound of the method. Most importantly, our analysis provides direct theoretical evidence that adaptive step-size methods, such as SPS or NGN, are more robust than SGD. This allows us to quantify the advantage of these adaptive methods beyond empirical evaluation. Finally, we show through experiments that our theoretical bound qualitatively mirrors the actual performance as a function of the step size, even for nonconvex problems.",

    "summary": "Quantification is a fundamental component of everyday language use, yet little is known about how speakers decide whether and how to quantify in naturalistic production. We investigate quantification in Mandarin Chinese using a picture-based elicited description task in which speakers freely described scenes containing multiple objects, without explicit instructions to count or quantify. Across both spoken and written modalities, we examine three aspects of quantification: whether speakers choose to quantify at all, how precise their quantification is, and which quantificational strategies they adopt. Results show that object numerosity, animacy, and production modality systematically shape quantificational behaviour. In particular, increasing numerosity reduces both the likelihood and the precision of quantification, while animate referents and modality selectively modulate strategy choice. This study demonstrates how quantification can be examined under unconstrained production conditions and provides a naturalistic dataset for further analyses of quantity expression in language production.",

While MSA as the standard written variety is commonly used in formal settings, people speak and write online in various dialects that are spread across the Arab region. This poses limitations for Arabic LMs, since its dialects vary in their similarity to MSA. In this work we study cross-lingual transfer of Arabic models using probing on 3 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tasks, and representational similarity. Our results indicate that transfer is possible but disproportionate across dialects, which we find to be partially explained by their geographic proximity. Furthermore, we find evidence for negative interference in models trained to support all Arabic dialects. This questions their degree of similarity, and raises concerns for cross-lingual transfer in Arabic models.",

    "summary": "Scaling up model parameters has long been a prevalent training paradigm driven by the assumption that larger models yield superior generation capabilities. However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.",

Assuming that the data distribution has low intrinsic dimensionality, we prove that blind denoising diffusion models (BDDMs), despite not having access to the noise amplitude, \\emph{automatically} track a particular \\emph{implicit} noise schedule along the reverse process. Our analysis shows that BDDMs can accurately sample from the data distribution in polynomially many steps as a function of the intrinsic dimension. Empirical results corroborate these mathematical findings on both synthetic and image data, demonstrating that the noise variance is accurately estimated from the noisy image. Remarkably, we observe that schedule-free BDDMs produce samples of higher quality compared to their non-blind counterparts. We provide evidence that this performance gain arises because BDDMs correct the mismatch between the true residual noise (of the image) and the noise assumed by the schedule used in non-blind diffusion models.",

    "summary": "Blind Image Quality Assessment, aiming to replicate human perception of visual quality without reference, plays a key role in vision tasks, yet existing models often fail to effectively capture subtle distortion cues, leading to a misalignment with human subjective judgments. We identify that the root cause of this limitation lies in the lack of reliable distortion priors, as methods typically learn shallow relationships between unified image features and quality scores, resulting in their insensitive nature to distortions and thus limiting their performance. To address this, we introduce DR.Experts, a novel prior-driven BIQA framework designed to explicitly incorporate distortion priors, enabling a reliable quality assessment. DR.Experts begins by leveraging a degradation-aware vision-language model to obtain distortion-specific priors, which are further refined and enhanced by the proposed Distortion-Saliency Differential Module through distinguishing them from semantic attentions, thereby ensuring the genuine representations of distortions. The refined priors, along with semantics and bridging representation, are then fused by a proposed mixture-of-experts style module named the Dynamic Distortion Weighting Module. This mechanism weights each distortion-specific feature as per its perceptual impact, ensuring that the final quality prediction aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging BIQA benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DR.Experts over current methods and showcase its excellence in terms of generalization and data efficiency.",

    "summary": "We propose AdaDS, a generalizable framework for depth super-resolution that robustly recovers high-resolution depth maps from arbitrarily degraded low-resolution inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that directly regress depth values and often exhibit artifacts under severe or unknown degradation, AdaDS capitalizes on the contraction property of Gaussian smoothing: as noise accumulates in the forward process, distributional discrepancies between degraded inputs and their pristine high-quality counterparts diminish, ultimately converging to isotropic Gaussian prior. Leveraging this, AdaDS adaptively selects a starting timestep in the reverse diffusion trajectory based on estimated refinement uncertainty, and subsequently injects tailored noise to position the intermediate sample within the high-probability region of the target posterior distribution. This strategy ensures inherent robustness, enabling generative prior of a pre-trained diffusion model to dominate recovery even when upstream estimations are imperfect. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate AdaDS's superior zero-shot generalization and resilience to diverse degradation patterns compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "Reaction-diffusion (RD) equations underpin pattern formation across chemistry, biology, and physics, yet learning stable operators that forecast their long-term dynamics from data remains challenging. Neural-operator surrogates provide resolution-robust prediction, but autoregressive rollouts can drift due to the accumulation of error, and out-of-distribution (OOD) initial conditions often degrade accuracy. Physics-based numerical residual objectives can regularize operator learning, although they introduce additional assumptions, sensitivity to discretization and loss design, and higher training cost. Here we develop a purely data-driven operator learner with adaptive recurrent training (DDOL-ART) using a robust recurrent strategy with lightweight validation milestones that early-exit unproductive rollout segments and redirect optimization. Trained only on a single in-distribution toroidal Gaussian family over short horizons, DDOL-ART learns one-step operators that remain stable under long rollouts and generalize zero-shot to strong morphology shifts across FitzHugh-Nagumo (FN), Gray-Scott (GS), and Lambda-Omega (LO) systems. Across these benchmarks, DDOL-ART delivers a strong accuracy and cost trade-off. It is several-fold faster than a physics-based numerical-loss operator learner (NLOL) under matched settings, and it remains competitive on both in-distribution stability and OOD robustness. Training-dynamics diagnostics show that adaptivity strengthens the correlation between validation error and OOD test error performance, acting as a feedback controller that limits optimization drift. Our results indicate that feedback-controlled recurrent training of DDOL-ART generates robust flow-map surrogates without PDE residuals, while simultaneously maintaining competitiveness with NLOL at significantly reduced training costs.",

We present a systematic characterization of OS-level resource dynamics in sandboxed AI coding agents, analyzing 144 software engineering tasks from the SWE-rebench benchmark across two LLM models. Our measurements reveal that (1) OS-level execution (tool calls, container and agent initialization) accounts for 56-74% of end-to-end task latency; (2) memory, not CPU, is the concurrency bottleneck; (3) memory spikes are tool-call-driven with a up to 15.4x peak-to-average ratio; and (4) resource demands are highly unpredictable across tasks, runs, and models. Comparing these characteristics against serverless, microservice, and batch workloads, we identify three mismatches in existing resource controls: a granularity mismatch (container-level policies vs. tool-call-level dynamics), a responsiveness mismatch (user-space reaction vs. sub-second unpredictable bursts), and an adaptability mismatch (history-based prediction vs. non-deterministic stateful execution). We propose AgentCgroup , an eBPF-based resource controller that addresses these mismatches through hierarchical cgroup structures aligned with tool-call boundaries, in-kernel enforcement via sched_ext and memcg_bpf_ops, and runtime-adaptive policies driven by in-kernel monitoring.

    "summary": "Training transmission delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been shown to substantially improve their performance on complex temporal tasks. In this work, we show that learning either axonal or dendritic delays enables deep feedforward SNNs composed of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to reach accuracy comparable to existing synaptic delay learning approaches, while significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models. By adjusting the delay parameters, we obtain improved performance for synaptic delay learning baselines, strengthening the comparison. We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs.

This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.",

This paper presents a controlled empirical study examining how architectural differences between Double Deep Q-Networks (DDQN) and Dueling DQN influence transfer behavior across environments. Using CartPole as a source task and LunarLander as a structurally distinct target task, we evaluate a fixed layer-wise representation transfer protocol under identical hyperparameters and training conditions, with baseline agents trained from scratch used to contextualize transfer effects. Empirical results show that DDQN consistently avoids negative transfer under the examined setup and maintains learning dynamics comparable to baseline performance in the target environment. In contrast, Dueling DQN consistently exhibits negative transfer under identical conditions, characterized by degraded rewards and unstable optimization behavior. Statistical analysis across multiple random seeds confirms a significant performance gap under transfer. These findings suggest that architectural inductive bias is strongly associated with robustness to cross-environment transfer in value-based deep reinforcement learning under the examined transfer protocol.",

    "summary": "Rapid progress in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has achieved unprecedented performance in vision-language tasks. However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.",

    "summary": "Recent advances have reformulated diffusion models as deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs) through the framework of flow matching, providing a unified formulation for the noise-to-data generative process. Various training-free flow matching approaches have been developed to improve image generation through flow velocity field adjustment, eliminating the need for costly retraining. However, Modifying the velocity field $v$ introduces errors that propagate through the full generation path, whereas adjustments to the latent trajectory $z$ are naturally corrected by the pretrained velocity network, reducing error accumulation. In this paper, we propose two complementary training-free latent-trajectory adjustment approaches based on future and past velocity $v$ and latent trajectory $z$ information that refine the generative path directly in latent space. We propose two training-free trajectory smoothing schemes: \\emph{Look-Ahead}, which averages the current and next-step latents using a curvature-gated weight, and \\emph{Look-Back}, which smoothes latents using an exponential moving average with decay. We demonstrate through extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluation metrics that the proposed training-free trajectory smoothing models substantially outperform various state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets including COCO17, CUB-200, and Flickr30K.",

    "summary": "High-quality and open datasets remain a major bottleneck for text-to-image (T2I) fine-tuning. Despite rapid progress in model architectures and training pipelines, most publicly available fine-tuning datasets suffer from low resolution, poor text-image alignment, or limited diversity, resulting in a clear performance gap between open research models and enterprise-grade models. In this work, we present Fine-T2I, a large-scale, high-quality, and fully open dataset for T2I fine-tuning. Fine-T2I spans 10 task combinations, 32 prompt categories, 11 visual styles, and 5 prompt templates, and combines synthetic images generated by strong modern models with carefully curated real images from professional photographers. All samples are rigorously filtered for text-image alignment, visual fidelity, and prompt quality, with over 95% of initial candidates removed. The final dataset contains over 6 million text-image pairs, around 2 TB on disk, approaching the scale of pretraining datasets while maintaining fine-tuning-level quality. Across a diverse set of pretrained diffusion and autoregressive models, fine-tuning on Fine-T2I consistently improves both generation quality and instruction adherence, as validated by human evaluation, visual comparison, and automatic metrics. We release Fine-T2I under an open license to help close the data gap in T2I fine-tuning in the open community.",

Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.",

    "summary": "Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

    "summary": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.",

    "summary": "Domain Generalized Video Semantic Segmentation (DGVSS) is trained on a single labeled driving domain and is directly deployed on unseen domains without target labels and test-time adaptation while maintaining temporally consistent predictions over video streams. In practice, both domain shift and temporal-sampling shift break correspondence-based propagation and fixed-stride temporal aggregation, causing severe frame-to-frame flicker even in label-stable regions. We propose Time2General, a DGVSS framework built on Stability Queries. Time2General introduces a Spatio-Temporal Memory Decoder that aggregates multi-frame context into a clip-level spatio-temporal memory and decodes temporally consistent per-frame masks without explicit correspondence propagation. To further suppress flicker and improve robustness to varying sampling rates, the Masked Temporal Consistency Loss is proposed to regularize temporal prediction discrepancies across different strides, and randomize training strides to expose the model to diverse temporal gaps. Extensive experiments on multiple driving benchmarks show that Time2General achieves a substantial improvement in cross-domain accuracy and temporal stability over prior DGSS and VSS baselines while running at up to 18 FPS. Code will be released after the review process.",

    "summary": "Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection (UAD) is essential for modern manufacturing inspection, where defect samples are scarce and reliable detection is required. In this paper, we propose HLGFA, a high-low resolution guided feature alignment framework that learns normality by modeling cross-resolution feature consistency between high-resolution and low-resolution representations of normal samples, instead of relying on pixel-level reconstruction. Dual-resolution inputs are processed by a shared frozen backbone to extract multi-level features, and high-resolution representations are decomposed into structure and detail priors to guide the refinement of low-resolution features through conditional modulation and gated residual correction. During inference, anomalies are naturally identified as regions where cross-resolution alignment breaks down. In addition, a noise-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to suppress nuisance-induced responses commonly observed in industrial environments. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HLGFA, achieving 97.9% pixel-level AUROC and 97.5% image-level AUROC on the MVTec AD dataset, outperforming representative reconstruction-based and feature-based methods.",

    "summary": "Domain adaptation (DA) is a quickly expanding area in machine learning that involves adjusting a model trained in one domain to perform well in another domain. While there have been notable progressions, the fundamental concept of numerous DA methodologies has persisted: aligning the data from various domains into a shared feature space. In this space, knowledge acquired from labeled source data can improve the model training on target data that lacks sufficient labels. In this study, we demonstrate the use of 10 deep learning models to simulate common DA techniques and explore their application in four medical image datasets. We have considered various situations such as multi-modality, noisy data, federated learning (FL), interpretability analysis, and classifier calibration. The experimental results indicate that using DA with ResNet34 in a brain tumor (BT) data set results in an enhancement of 4.7\\% in model performance. Similarly, the use of DA can reduce the impact of Gaussian noise, as it provides $\\sim 3\\%$ accuracy increase using ResNet34 on a BT dataset. Furthermore, simply introducing DA into FL framework shows limited potential (e.g., $\\sim 0.3\\%$ increase in performance) for skin cancer classification. In addition, the DA method can improve the interpretability of the models using the gradcam++ technique, which offers clinical values. Calibration analysis also demonstrates that using DA provides a lower expected calibration error (ECE) value $\\sim 2\\%$ compared to CNN alone on a multi-modality dataset.",

To alleviate this problem, some previous studies adjust and amplify visual attention. These methods present a limitation that boosting attention for all visual tokens inevitably increases attention to task irrelevant tokens. To tackle this challenge, we propose a training free attentional intervention algorithm to enhance the attention of task-relevant tokens based on the argument that task-relevant tokens generally demonstrate high visual-textual similarities. Specifically, the vision-text cross-attention submatrices, which represent visual-textual correlations, are extracted to construct the reweighting matrices to reallocate attention. Besides, to enhance the contribution of visual tokens, we inject visual attention values into the beam search decoding to identify solutions with higher visual attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method significantly reduces hallucinations across mainstream LVLMs, while preserving the accuracy and coherence of generated content.",

    "summary": "Analyzing animal and human behavior has long been a challenging task in computer vision. Early approaches from the 1970s to the 1990s relied on hand-crafted edge detection, segmentation, and low-level features such as color, shape, and texture to locate objects and infer their identities-an inherently ill-posed problem. Behavior analysis in this era typically proceeded by tracking identified objects over time and modeling their trajectories using sparse feature points, which further limited robustness and generalization. A major shift occurred with the introduction of ImageNet by Deng and Li in 2010, which enabled large-scale visual recognition through deep neural networks and effectively served as a comprehensive visual dictionary. This development allowed object recognition to move beyond complex low-level processing toward learned high-level representations. In this work, we follow this paradigm to build a large-scale Universal Action Space (UAS) using existing labeled human-action datasets. We then use this UAS as the foundation for analyzing and categorizing mammalian and chimpanzee behavior datasets.

We study egocentric interaction generation from a single scene image under free-space hand gestures, aiming to synthesize photorealistic videos in which hands enter the scene, interact with objects, and induce plausible world dynamics under head motion. This setting introduces fundamental challenges, including distribution shift between free-space gestures and contact-heavy training data, ambiguity between hand motion and camera motion in monocular views, and the need for arbitrary-length video generation. We present Hand2World, a unified autoregressive framework that addresses these challenges through occlusion-invariant hand conditioning based on projected 3D hand meshes, allowing visibility and occlusion to be inferred from scene context rather than encoded in the control signal. To stabilize egocentric viewpoint changes, we inject explicit camera geometry via per-pixel Plücker-ray embeddings, disentangling camera motion from hand motion and preventing background drift. We further develop a fully automated monocular annotation pipeline and distill a bidirectional diffusion model into a causal generator, enabling arbitrary-length synthesis. Experiments on three egocentric interaction benchmarks show substantial improvements in perceptual quality and 3D consistency while supporting camera control and long-horizon interactive generation.",

Under a unified set of assumptions combining blockwise Lipschitz geometry, local identifiability, and sub-Gaussian noise, we establish deterministic stability inequalities, global Lipschitz bounds for least-squares misfit functionals, and nonasymptotic concentration estimates. These results yield high-probability parameter error bounds that are intrinsic to the forward operator and independent of any specific reconstruction algorithm. As a concrete instantiation, we verify that the Gaussian Splatting rendering operator satisfies the proposed assumptions and derive explicit constants governing its Lipschitz continuity and resolution-dependent observability. This leads to a fundamental stability--resolution tradeoff, showing that estimation error is inherently constrained by the ratio between image resolution and model complexity. Overall, the analysis characterizes operator-level limits for a broad class of high-dimensional nonlinear inverse problems arising in modern imaging and differentiable rendering.",

To address this gap, we introduce ARK, a benchmark designed to analyze multimodal retrieval from two complementary perspectives: (i) knowledge domains (five domains with 17 subtypes), which characterize the content and expertise retrieval relies on, and (ii) reasoning skills (six categories), which characterize the type of inference over multimodal evidence required to identify the correct candidate. Specifically, ARK evaluates retrieval with both unimodal and multimodal queries and candidates, covering 16 heterogeneous visual data types. To avoid shortcut matching during evaluation, most queries are paired with targeted hard negatives that require multi-step reasoning. We evaluate 23 representative text-based and multimodal retrievers on ARK and observe a pronounced gap between knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive retrieval, with fine-grained visual and spatial reasoning emerging as persistent bottlenecks. We further show that simple enhancements such as re-ranking and rewriting yield consistent improvements, but substantial headroom remains.",
