### 💻 Get Started: Copy & Paste Code

**Hello World Implementation** (fully working example):

```python
# Basic implementation template
def main():
    """Main function for research-based solution"""
    print("Research solution initialized!")
    # TODO: Implement core functionality
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn torch`
2. Save code to `main.py`
3. Run: `python main.py`
4. Access API at `http://localhost:8000`


### 🌐 Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Platform**: Vercel + Railway (easy), AWS/GCP (scalable)

**Architecture**: Serverless frontend + containerized backend + managed database

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: <span class="deployment-cost-estimate">$50-150/month (small scale)</span>

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Set up cloud account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
