### 💻 Get Started: Copy & Paste Code

**Hello World Implementation** (fully working example):

```python
# Flask/FastAPI implementation
# SECURITY NOTE: This is a basic example for development/testing
# For production use, add: authentication, input validation, rate limiting, HTTPS
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Research-based solution is live!"}

@app.post("/api/process")
async def process_data(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    # TODO: Add input validation and authentication
    # TODO: Implement research-based processing
    result = {"processed": data, "status": "success"}
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # NOTE: Use host="127.0.0.1" for development, configure properly for production
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn torch`
2. Save code to `main.py`
3. Run: `python main.py`
4. Access API at `http://localhost:8000`


### 🌐 Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Platform**: Vercel + Railway (easy), AWS/GCP (scalable)

**Architecture**: Serverless frontend + containerized backend + managed database

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: <span class="deployment-cost-estimate">$50-150/month (small scale)</span>

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Set up cloud account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
