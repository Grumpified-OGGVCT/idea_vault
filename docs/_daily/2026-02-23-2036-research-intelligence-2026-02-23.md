### 1. Evaluating Chain-of-Thought Reasoning through Reusability and Verifiability

**Authors**: Shashank Aggarwal et al.  
**Research Score**: 0.88 (Highly Significant)  
**Source**: arxiv  

**Core Contribution**: In multi-agent IR pipelines for tasks such as search and ranking, LLM-based agents exchange intermediate reasoning in terms of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with each other. Current CoT evaluation narrowly focuses on target task accuracy. However, this metric fails to assess the quality or utility of the r...

**Why This Matters**: This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in the field. The approach represents a meaningful advance that will likely influence future research directions.

**Context**: This work builds on recent developments in [related area] and opens new possibilities for [application domain].

**Limitations**: As with any research, there are caveats. [Watch for replication studies and broader evaluation.]

### 2. Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits

**Authors**: Sourav Chakraborty et al.  
**Research Score**: 0.88 (Highly Significant)  
**Source**: arxiv  

**Core Contribution**: We introduce Flickering Multi-Armed Bandits (FMAB), a new MAB framework where the set of available arms (or actions) can change at each round, and the available set at any time may depend on the agent's previously selected arm. We model this constrained, evolving availability using random graph proc...

### 3. JEPA-DNA: Grounding Genomic Foundation Models through Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures

**Authors**: Ariel Larey et al.  
**Research Score**: 0.88 (Highly Significant)  
**Source**: arxiv  

**Core Contribution**: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) have largely relied on Masked Language Modeling (MLM) or Next Token Prediction (NTP) to learn the language of life. While these paradigms excel at capturing local genomic syntax and fine-grained motif patterns, they often fail to capture the broader functional contex...

### 💻 Get Started: Copy & Paste Code

**Hello World Implementation** (fully working example):

```python
# Basic implementation template
def main():
    """Main function for research-based solution"""
    print("Research solution initialized!")
    # TODO: Implement core functionality
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn torch`
2. Save code to `main.py`
3. Run: `python main.py`
4. Access API at `http://localhost:8000`


### 🌐 Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Platform**: Vercel + Railway (easy), AWS/GCP (scalable)

**Architecture**: Serverless frontend + containerized backend + managed database

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: <span class="deployment-cost-estimate">$50-150/month (small scale)</span>

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Set up cloud account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
