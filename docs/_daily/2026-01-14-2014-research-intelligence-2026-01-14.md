### 💻 Get Started: Copy & Paste Code

**Hello World Implementation** (fully working example):

```python
# PyTorch implementation
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class ResearchModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_dim=768, hidden_dim=512, output_dim=256):
        super(ResearchModel, self).__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(input_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(hidden_dim, num_heads=8)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # Note: Adjust input shape for your specific use case
        # MultiheadAttention expects (seq_len, batch, embed_dim)
        x = torch.relu(self.layer1(x))
        # For batch-first attention, reshape x appropriately
        x = x.unsqueeze(0)  # Add sequence dimension
        x, _ = self.attention(x, x, x)
        x = x.squeeze(0)  # Remove sequence dimension
        x = self.output(x)
        return x

# Example usage
model = ResearchModel()
sample_input = torch.randn(32, 768)  # Batch of 32
output = model(sample_input)
print(f"Output shape: {output.shape}")
```

**Next Steps**:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install fastapi uvicorn torch`
2. Save code to `main.py`
3. Run: `python main.py`
4. Access API at `http://localhost:8000`


### 🌐 Deployment Strategy

**Recommended Platform**: Vercel + Railway (easy), AWS/GCP (scalable)

**Architecture**: Serverless frontend + containerized backend + managed database

**Estimated Monthly Cost**: <span class="deployment-cost-estimate">$50-150/month (small scale)</span>

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Set up cloud account
2. Configure environment variables
3. Deploy backend to Railway/Render
4. Deploy frontend to Vercel
